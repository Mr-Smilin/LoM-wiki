Apart from the back mountain, main hall, scripture hall, and main gate,  
all other buildings have initial encounter events. Move the cursor over the buildings to interact.

The martial arts world is treacherous, even within the Tangmen sect, it is a microcosm of the martial arts world.  
In the early stages, you need to quickly accumulate strength, practice martial arts in the training ground,  
obtain secret manuals to train in the back mountain, and after reaching sect level 2, forge the Heart-Protecting Mirror (second-level armor) in the forging workshop.

In addition, each building has its own events, so explore everywhere and save frequently!
