Action Points represent the number of interactions available  
Initially starting with three points, achievements can increase this number  
Each interaction consumes an Action Point, and when all points are used up, it will move to the next time period

<br>

Each month is divided into **early**, **mid**, and **late** periods  
Some events **will be missed if not triggered during a specific period**  
Players need to plan carefully, improve their skills within the limited actions, trigger adventures, and form connections with various fates.
