## {{ $frontmatter.title }}

-   Destiny Points = Inheritance Points
-   Destiny Points can be obtained through various plot events after the start of the game, but do not affect Inheritance Points
-   Achieving the [[Book of History]], [[Book of Life and Death]], and [[Chronicles of the World]] will affect Inheritance Points

## Uses of Destiny Points

-   Use Destiny Points to reroll with the **Wheel of Fate**, consuming one Destiny Point each time
-   After multiple playthroughs, adjust the protagonist's attributes, relationships, and the favorability of various sects at the start
-   In certain key events, spend a certain amount of Destiny Points to change tragedies that were originally unavoidable
