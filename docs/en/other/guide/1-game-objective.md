## {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Play as the game protagonist "Zhao Huo" and weave the story of a heroic figure over these four years.  
The dice are not your friends, the world is against you at every turn.  
Even as an ordinary person, despite stumbling along the way, you still bravely challenge life.

> **If you can hold your head high, you are definitely not relying on anyone's shelter.**  
> **You must be walking against the wind, with a proud spirit, standing tall and firm.**

<!-- Having no special abilities, that's what makes a true hero. -->
