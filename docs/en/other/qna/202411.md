> What are the daily routines of Jinxiang Palace and Tangmen? 

Jinxiang Palace requires disciples to learn martial arts for self-defense and music for character cultivation, while Tangmen is less strict but everyone has to work honestly.

> What are the rewards and punishments for failing or excelling in exams like music or martial arts at Jinxiang Palace? Among the characters from Jinxiang Palace, excluding Lady Wen, whose music skills are closest to the palace master?

Excelling can earn extra pocket money and holidays. Mingyu, who has been with Lady Wen the longest, has the best music skills.

> From some plot points, it seems that Lady Wen personally guided Long Xiang in studying and martial arts. Does Lady Wen know that Long Xiang's geography knowledge is not very good?

She knows and forces her to study, but the results are limited. She's okay with local geography but struggles with distant places.

> How is Long Xiang's speech and etiquette when she's outside? Since she's allowed by Lady Wen, she should be fine?

Long Xiang is educated to be very polite and behaves like a refined lady when not wielding a sword.

> During Long Xiang's time at Jinxiang Palace, what was the biggest trouble she caused that made Lady Wen the angriest?

Practicing swordplay with a live chicken.

> When practicing swordplay with a live chicken, was she planning to kill the chicken to practice or just swinging it around?

Using a flexible sword to stab the chicken.

> Are there any other relatives of the Long family?

No.

> Who crafted the Tianchang Sword and is the grandmaster of that generation still alive or have descendants? Ahuo and Xiaozhu, the two iron-forging enthusiasts, should be very interested in the Tianchang Sword. Would they seek advice?

The Tianchang Sword was forged by the Fire Flame Mountain Sword Pavilion. Anyone would be interested in the Tianchang Sword.

> Did Long Xiang ever try to work and earn pocket money while living at Jinxiang Palace?

Yes, Lady Wen arranged for her to work in the business managed by Jinxiang Palace. She's actually good at swimming but doesn't seem to have practical skills.

> Did Long Xiang ever cause an explosion in the kitchen at Jinxiang Palace?

No explosion, just a fire! Don't exaggerate!

> Was the martial arts of Jinxiang Palace created by Lady Wen alone or in collaboration with the initial 11 people? How many of the original 11 members of Jinxiang Palace are still alive?

Some learned from the Nan Gong family, some from the Yuwen family, some were taught by her husband, and they also consulted the initial 11 members. Only Lady Wen, Mingyu, and Huaxian'er remain.

> Will Tang Fang actually treat everyone to dumplings and drinks next time?

Yes, but not willingly.

> Long Xiang mentioned the panic when talking about her room at Jinxiang Palace and the conversation between Ahuo and Xiaohou Lan. She mentioned that the master's room is different from hers. Does this mean Long Xiang's room is messy, possibly to the point of being punished by Lady Wen with a cane?

It's not messy, but Long Xiang's room has many things she likes, including some childhood toys, which she's shy to show.

> Are there other industries or facilities in Tangmen that haven't been mentioned yet (like a demo version of a training tower)?

No.

> Many newcomers in the martial arts world like to claim both parents are deceased, but what about Qi Ren? How is his relationship with his parents?

Qi Ren's parents are alive, but he claims they're deceased to the public and portrays himself as a lone wolf wandering the world.

> Where did Qi Ren's twin swords come from?

He bought them with money from his parents.

> Although Qi Ren's martial arts skills are good (as seen from his ability to break the Stone Gang leader's hard qigong), his behavior often provokes others. Why hasn't he been beaten to death yet?

Because he's Dragon Proud Heaven.

> Does he have any friends?

Yes, Dragon Proud Heaven has a mysterious charm that not only makes women fall for him instantly but also attracts men who willingly become his stepping stones and are willing to sacrifice themselves cheaply at critical moments.

> What exactly is the Tian Gang Subduing Demon Sword, and how did Long Yuan manage to create it barehanded? Also, what's up with that weird Creation Art?

The Tian Gang Subduing Demon Sword is the ultimate secret technique Long Yuan realized after mastering the Seven Absolute Martial Arts.

> Will there be a route where Ahuo travels with Dog Sister? (Not in the image, asked separately)

(Can't spoil)

> What was Zou Dao like when he was young?

Zou Dao was tall and handsome when he was young, with a bit of a rogue vibe. He had a strong sense of justice and later realized he couldn't be so decadent, so he worked hard to achieve his current results.

> After completing a romance route with a female character in the game, it would be nice to have the female character stand with Ahuo in the title screen. Will the female character disappear from the title screen after restarting the game? (Ahuo is too lonely by himself)

This idea seems good, but it might lead to other complications that need to be considered.

> Will there be exclusive CG images of Ahuo marrying each of the female leads?

The romance images serve that purpose.

> What is Bird Bear's view on martial arts prodigies? Setting aside this question, if I were to express my own opinion, Zhao Huo correctly understood this through the enlightenment of the master, which is a teaching method suitable for Zhao Huo to become stronger. However, I don't think Zhao Huo is particularly talented in martial arts.

Zhao Huo is close to the situation you described, but there's another important factor: the person who taught him martial arts attempted to completely eliminate the threshold for learning martial arts, allowing future generations to learn self-defense.

> Will there be DLCs with other costume styles, or ones specifically for Ahuo?

There are no plans for other costume DLCs.

> Is Ye Yunchang's feelings for Tang Moling based on sexual attraction?

Your question is profound, and innocent Bird Bear doesn't understand.

> Whose idea was the sword in the Hero's Legend logo?

It wasn't anyone specific, just randomly drawn by Bear.

> How did Xiang Wuyou meet Third Sister and end up being chased by Xiahou Lan?

They met in social circles in the martial arts world.

> How skilled is Tang Fang in medicine?

The fact that her second senior brother allowed her to travel indicates she's quite skilled. In the vast Central Plains, it's not easy to find a doctor more skilled than her.

> Second Senior Brother has too few scenes. Will he have a dedicated storyline in the future?

He will have more scenes in the future.

> Does Bird Bear prefer a loli style or a mature woman style?

No preference.

> Will Big Senior Brother continue to grow after the ending? What will Long Yuan do after the ending of Long Xiang's romance line (the extermination line where Long Xiang and Ahuo are defeated)? Why didn't he help Ahuo and Xiang Jie at that time? How will Long Yuan react upon hearing the news? Also, how will Big Senior Brother react upon learning that his junior brother has died?

Big Senior Brother will become addicted to crosstalk and neglect his martial arts until it deteriorates. Long Yuan's fate is a spoiler, so it can't be revealed. Big Senior Brother, upon learning of his junior brother's death, will seek revenge and may not resort to killing, depending on the circumstances.

> (Another question but different) If Long Xiang's romance leads to the extermination line, what actions would Long Yuan take?

Long Yuan's fate is a spoiler, so it can't be revealed.

> Will the second part of the Nine Transformations technique (DLC) explain its origins in detail? Will new regions be opened?

(Can't spoil)

> Who is more overworked, Sect Leader Xiang or Third Senior Brother?

Third Senior Brother. After all, Emei Sect isn't in debt, and its disciples don't cause trouble.

> Did Xiang Jie witnessing the brotherly bond between Wang Erzhuang and Lady Wen lead her to want to address Ahuo as a brother? 

Yes.

> Is Xiang Jie's love for chicken influenced by Wang Erzhuang calling her "Chicken Legs"?

To a large extent.

> Does Xiang Jie have any other favorite chicken dishes?

She loves all chicken dishes.

> Do people in the Hero's Legend celebrate festivals?

Yes, the livelier the place, the more they enjoy festivals. However, Tangmen wants to celebrate but has financial constraints.

> Besides alcohol, will there be other edible items in the future, such as elixirs and medicines?

Yes.

> How is Xiahou Lan's singing voice?

Generally good.

> Does Ahuo practice crane movements regularly, or does he only demonstrate this ability to others?

Ahuo uses crane hand gestures to communicate with Huo Shandian. If Huo Shandian doesn't respond promptly or makes a "= =" expression, he'll be slapped.

> How high is Wei Ju's lecherous forehead?

Quite high; a full forehead indicates good fortune.

> When Second Senior Brother enters Jinxiang Palace in a spy's identity, does he cross-dress?

No.

> Is Nangong Shen's mother alive, and does she have any feelings for the Nangong family?

She's alive but doesn't live with the Nangong family. She returned to her family many years ago and has little contact with the Nangong family.

> Nangong family servants are well-off, so why do they keep giving 1000 to Ahuo?

The Nangong family servants have high salaries, equivalent to Bird Bear's monthly salary.

> Is Bird Bear currently in good health?

Recovering in rehabilitation.

> How much blood does Ye Mei vomit every day?

It's not a regular occurrence.

> Thank you, Bird Bear, for bringing us such a great work. It's the best visual novel I've ever seen in my life. I don't have any questions, just wanted to express my gratitude to Bird Bear. Keep up the good work, and I will continue to support you!

Thank you very much! We will continue to create! 

> How did Zhao Huo manage to defeat Rui Sheng and other experts in the assassination line 1 person + romance female lead? Is this possible, and how did he win?

This is possible, with many factors worth analyzing and discussing. It's an interesting question, and I think it's best left for everyone to discuss. (There is an official answer, but it can't be disclosed)

> Does Xiang Jie fear the dark or insects, or is she the type who dares to catch bugs with her bare hands and walk around without a light?

She doesn't like bugs but won't scream if she encounters them. She's not afraid of the dark, but she wouldn't be reckless enough to go out without a light.

> Is there any creature she's afraid of? For example, Lady Wen... cough cough.

Of course, she still has fears; otherwise, no one could control her.

> How about animals?

She's very brave.

> Given Lady Wen's harsh use of the cane on Long Xiang, could she develop PTSD and be afraid of weapons related to canes in the future? Or would she be afraid to use a cane to discipline her own children?

No.

> If Long Xiang had the chance to see the deceased Lady Wen again, what would be the first thing she'd say to her (in the romance version)?

This question is for you to think about~
