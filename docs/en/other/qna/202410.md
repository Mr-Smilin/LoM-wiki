> 上官隼對蘇迎香是一種尊重和欣賞的感情，他認為蘇迎香是一位優秀的武者，值得尊敬。
This can get complicated, with desires, identity, admiration, and love-hate relationships.

> Will Sheng Xue officially have a name now? Instead of being called Jin Xiang's disciple.

No.

> Bird Bear, Golden Retriever, Chihuahua, and Husky each make up Long Xiang's composition.

It's subjective!

> Xiahou Lan's reaction to Lady Wen's night letter at the martial arts conference? Other female characters have the opportunity to hear it, only Xiahou Lan doesn't. Xiahou Lan and Lady Wen's mutual evaluation of each other?

Because she didn't hear it, so we don't know either. Maybe it would be very sentimental. They have met before, let's keep their thoughts to themselves for now.

> Is Junior Sister afraid of the cold?

Yes.

> Why does Ah Huo shave? What cuisine does Master Lan like?

Because older non-Tang Clan disciples are advised to leave the Tang Clan, and Zhao Huo doesn't want to look old. Xiahou Lan likes hot pot.

> How do the famous passers-by living in Meizhen and Wai Bao usually live?

They live normally, some do business in Wai Bao, some simply live in affordable housing, making a living elsewhere.

> Does Zhao Huo like pepper? Why does he keep adding it?

Zhao Huo doesn't particularly like pepper; the pepper he adds is actually not the pepper we are familiar with but a unique Tang Clan poison.

> How much do Ah Huo and Long Xiang earn from the Chicken Leg Tycoon storyline, and approximately how many children do they have?

I guess they don't earn much, and they are the type to spend what they earn. As for how many children, that's hard to say.

> How many times has Rui Sheng been rejected by girls?

Around 3-4 times.

> Was Tang Lao Mo a rogue when he was young? I hope future updates will help him regain his memory line.

It's possible.

> How did Master handle food issues when living alone in the Soul-Stealing Forest?

She would hunt forest animals, grow vegetables outside the forest, and occasionally buy food in town.

> How did the inspiration for the ending of the Sea Rusher come about initially? Did Long Yuan peek?

There wasn't any special inspiration; the dragon wanted to enter the sea, so leaving was related to the sea. Long Yuan didn't peek; he's not always idle at the back of the Tang Clan.

> Is there still a possibility for Ye Yunshang to grow taller?

There is still some room for growth, but she needs to take care of her health first.

> What is the source of Zhao Huo's motivation?

Springs, magnets, and Gater wires.

> What was Xiahou Lan's personality like during the reconciliation with Dustless on the trip with the group? How different was it from when she first met Zhao Huo?

Xiahou Lan was gentle and reserved as a young girl, full of compassion, protecting the weak, and fighting against injustice. She leans more towards dialogue than violence.

> Sister Xiang loves meat buns a lot, why is she always queuing up?

Those meat buns are very famous, with a sauce-flavored chicken filling, can you blame her for not being able to resist? When she sees them, she has to queue up.

> What is Sister Xiang's specialty dish?

Charcoal.

> How much silver can Shangguan Ying earn in a day?

Those in big business can't focus on daily income and expenses; they need to look at the long term. Shangguan Ying earns not just money but also integrity and connections, deepening the foundation of the Shangguan family in the Song Kingdom.

> What is Xiao Zhu's most handy weapon at the moment?

In the current game version, her storyline cannot be triggered. By default, the most powerful weapon she has created is the Tiger Tank and Rocket Fist. There are even more powerful weapons in unreleased content.

> Can Big Brother give up his promise with Zhao Huo for two dumplings? How many chicken legs would it take to make Sister Xiang hesitate?

It depends on the person. Usually, she is very trustworthy and will go to the appointment with a chicken leg in hand.

> Does Bird Bear have a text ranking of all characters? Of course, I ask this to confirm if there is a standard value, not to ask which character is stronger than another.

There is a rough setting, but having higher martial arts skills doesn't guarantee victory in a fight. Even the ultimate Zhao Huo could be caught off guard and pushed downstairs by Xiao Mei.

> Apart from Sheng Xue, Lady Wen, and the Painting Fairy, who is the most favored by Sister Xiang in the Jin Xiang Palace?

Ming Yu.

> Is there a possibility of increasing Long Xiang's participation in battles (referring to puppets)?

Yes.

> What is the source of income for the Jin Xiang Palace?

The women of the Jin Xiang Palace all have their own jobs, running restaurants and weaving in Yueyang. They also sell embroidery and knots.

> Does the Jin Xiang Palace have a character similar to the Fourth Junior Brother? Do they sponsor or secretly sponsor a character with a fetish (Rui Xing) from the Nan Gong family?

There is no character like the Fourth Junior Brother. Rui Xing only sends gifts to Lady Wen on special occasions and does not provide additional sponsorship. She knows Lady Wen disapproves of this and intends for the palace residents to be self-sufficient.

> How much does it cost to support Long Xiang for a month (post-joining period & Jin Xiang Palace period)? What percentage of the Jin Xiang Palace's income does it account for during the Jin Xiang Palace period?

During the Jin Xiang Palace period, Long Xiang's pocket money and food expenses are limited. After joining, her food expenses depend on your generosity. You can also give her dry steamed buns as a makeshift.

> Currently, the Thousand Lantern Tower seems a bit weak, and it's not as difficult to dismantle as Long Yuan and the innkeeper claim. The current discussion suggests that most of the high-level experts of the Thousand Lantern Tower have not appeared. Is this really the case, or does Bird Bear actually plan to have them appear but not now?

They are a mysterious assassin organization, so they won't easily show themselves in public.

> On the character of Long Xiang or other bondable characters, is there a chance they will be taken in by the Tang Clan as half-disciples of an external surname or become a daughter-in-law of the Tang Clan by bonding with Zhao Huo (or does an external surname not count)? In that case, do they need to eat poisonous meals for toxin resistance training? Can they learn Tang Clan martial arts or techniques? Are the poisonous meals delicious (from Long Xiang's perspective)?

They cannot learn martial arts or techniques but can eat poisonous meals to improve their physique. Typically, these meals are spicy and numbing, quite tasty, but not forced if one can't handle them.

> Does Liu Ya have naturally sharp teeth?

Unknown.

> Where does Liu Ya's muscular build come from, and how did he learn Japanese/Chinese?

Having muscles is quite common, and he learned Japanese from frequent visits to Japan, even kidnapping Japanese pirates.

> Is Master Che considered an invincible superhuman in the Mud Sect, or does he lean more towards the Wind Forest Temple (Note: The Strongest Disciple One) in terms of strength? He sounds quite powerful from what I've heard.

You could consider him that way.

> (Original question not disclosed)

Long Xiang is great, one of the types worth loving the most.

> After the Western Martial Arts, does Sister Xiang have a chance to have seven children with Ah Huo? ~~Because Long Xiang is one of the Seven Wonders.~~

Having children is a matter of fate; it's not as simple as wanting a specific number. In any case, she is very healthy.

> How does Sister Xiang take care of her hair? For example, how does she wash it when it gets dirty?

During the Song Dynasty, people mostly used plain water for washing. The residents of the Jin Xiang Palace would use soapberry and mugwort boiled in water to wash their hair.

> Will Zhou Zhou repay debts?

Yes, Ye Yunzhou will repay debts; he will find various ways to repay them.

> Has Bird Bear encountered people like Junior Sister, Xiahou Lan, and Sister Xiang in real life, or are the characters based on them? Or does he create characters based on the books he has read and his knowledge?

Both.
