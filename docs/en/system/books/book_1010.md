The secret technique of the Flying Stone Gang, passed down to the gang leader when he was young by a master, is a unique hidden weapon technique.

It is said that when practiced to a high level, one can skip a stone on calm water surface, bouncing it eighty-eight times.

## Acquisition Method

- One year in the kitchen - spar with the eldest senior brother of the Flying Stone Gang

## Notes

- In reality, it was summarized by [[Master Shi]] before he tied his hair up, later copied by [[Lady Shi]], claiming the book contained profound martial arts, but only disciples of the gang could read it, hardly considered a true skill.
- When used by [[Tang Buyi]], it was completely transformed, with stones flying and leaping, able to turn and attack from behind, a continuous stream of stones thrown out, instantly surrounding the opponent like a barrage of stone bullets from all directions, truly living up to the name of the Forgotten Form chapter.
