The Daoist Canglong Yin is likened to the roar of the Nine Heavens Dragon, describing the ascension of a Daoist with a clear whistle, as clear and bright as the roar of a dragon breaking through the sky.
<br><br>
This technique requires the internal qi to be released externally from the dantian. When engaging with others, the practitioner unleashes their power with a roar, a sound as thunderous as a swift and powerful flood, captivating the hearts and souls of others, and even causing internal injuries.
