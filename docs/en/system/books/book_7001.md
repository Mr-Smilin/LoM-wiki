The Beggar Gang's song "Falling Lotus," sung by everyone in the gang, is actually a set of internal martial arts techniques focused on survival skills.
<br><br>
After work every night, older beggars lead the younger ones in singing together, tapping bowls with chopsticks to keep the rhythm, coordinating their breathing with the song, forming a natural habit of breathing exercises.
However, the lyrics are often crude and disrespectful, bringing shame, and some may even be reported to the authorities for singing in front of young women.
