# Nine Treasures Map of Wushan Cave

<BookItemIcon :size="`medium`" :needLink="false" :no="7007"></BookItemIcon>

Hidden in the stalactite cave where Wushan and the Yangtze River intersect, the mysterious martial arts depicted on the walls have an unknown origin and history spanning several dynasties. Illustrated through nine interconnected diagrams, the practice method seems to be both righteous and evil, far from ordinary martial arts techniques, yet concise and impactful.

Discovered by a fisherman who accidentally fell into the water, the diagrams were copied and presented to the court in exchange for a reward. However, the court did not pay much attention to this martial art, and it was subsequently buried among the shelves of the nobility.

As the water level rose, the stalactite cave was completely submerged.

## Notes

- Legendary document presented by Nan Gongshen: Nan Gongshen knows that you have not received guidance from a master, and he worries that your forced cultivation of internal energy may lead to imbalance of Yin and Yang, harming your body and meridians. Therefore, he gifts you a set of internal energy diagrams called the "Nine Treasures Map of Wushan Cave." Nan Gongshen humbly states that practicing it will not lead to mastering peerless martial arts, but it can help you harmonize the two principles and nurture the five elements, providing you with benefits. In truth, he is afraid that you will realize the value of this diagram and refuse to accept it easily.
