Originating from the esoteric Zen practice of the Western Regions, the training method is completely different from Central Plains martial arts, not only in its peculiar postures but also in its cryptic language. The translation of the final two chapters is so confusing that it is difficult to read.
<br><br>
Practicing this Zen technique emphasizes physical practice, requiring the lighting of charcoal and wood, laying sharp broken stones on top, and then practicing on the stones. Practitioners must operate their internal energy silently, expelling heat from their bodies, or else they will risk being burned.
<br><br>
It is said that reaching the highest level of practice allows one to meditate and float in the air, dislocate and elongate joints to strike, and spit out flames.
<br><br>
However, the content of the final two chapters remains unseen, making this level seemingly unattainable.

-   Fire Zen: When in a state of "anger," no longer poking people, instead using mouth attacks and spitting fire to cause enemies to "burn" (lose 7% of health per turn, lasting 3 turns)

## Acquisition

-   Two years of studying abroad at the Kongtong Sect - Feitian Gate Seasonal Trial victory (â‰¥25 favorability with [[Yu Xiaomei]]) or two victories (<25 favorability with [[Yu Xiaomei]]) as a reward

## Notes

-   The only secret technique in the current version that can increase Yin and Yang (v1.0.3131)
-   Meditating and floating, elongating limbs to strike, and spitting fire are all reminiscent of Dhalsim from "Street Fighter"
