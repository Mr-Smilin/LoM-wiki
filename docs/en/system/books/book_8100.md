The demonic technique of Ni Jiao Tian Dao.
<br><br>
A health-preserving qigong evolved from medical books, based on traditional Chinese medicine's "warming method." It uses warm and pungent herbs to moxibustion acupoints, dispelling cold energy and nourishing blood and qi. It is very effective, with the ability to reverse declining yang energy.

## Acquisition

- Early April - Fourth Senior Brother's purchase ($1200)

## Notes

- Since in the current version (v1.0.3131), the only book that can increase Yin-Yang is the "Two Years of Intense Fire Zen," this secret technique is essentially useless.
