The profound sword technique of the Diancang Sect, the sword light rushes like a shooting star, covering thousands of miles.
<br><br>
Not seeking elegance, only seeking instant release. Delving into the two words "quick sword," merging body and sword, intention and action advancing together, so fast that even the shadow cannot catch up with the body movements.
<br><br>
"Feet step, bow bends, release," regardless of the body shape, cannot depart from these three principles. Its speed is like an arrow leaving the bowstring, arriving in an instant, able to deceive the enemy in an instant, either succeeding or dying trying.
