<BookItemIcon :size="`medium`" :needLink="false" :no="7000"></BookItemIcon>

A classic trick used by many villains in the martial arts world.
<br><br>
When facing a powerful enemy, if unable to defeat them, seize the opportunity to block the meridians in your body, causing the blood and energy to stagnate, pulse to temporarily stop, appearing as if dead.
<br><br>
After the enemy leaves, use the hidden quicklime in your palm to generate heat and awaken yourself.
<br><br>
However, using this internal technique comes with high risks. If the awakening mechanism is not very effective, waking up may result in becoming mentally impaired due to lack of oxygen to the brain. Furthermore, if you provoke a ruthless character and they see you fall without hesitation, they may deliver a fatal blow, turning your feigned death into a real one.
