This sword technique originated from the Confucianism teachings of Confucius, who taught his disciples swordsmanship along with equestrian skills. As Confucius traveled through various states, he collected sword techniques from seven different states, constantly improving and refining them. Over the course of several dynasties, the techniques were further perfected, embodying the spirit of "the sky is healthy, the gentleman strives without ceasing," showing resilience and continuous improvement.
<br><br>
Act with humility, avoid contention, without attachment, without aversion, facing great challenges without being swayed, this is known as the humble and peaceful sword, the sword of a gentleman.
