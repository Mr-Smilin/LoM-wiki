## Notes

-   Feitian Sect's secret technique
-   Originally a righteous practice, if one can calmly and steadily practice, absorb summer Qi, and temper the internal organs, success will eventually be achieved
-   Due to the intense rivalry between Feitian and Soul Stealing Sects, the seniors of Feitian Sect created an expedited training method, forcefully stimulating the internal organs with fiery poison, tormenting them. Those who can survive this ordeal without dying can achieve success. However, disciples who practice this method are likely to have short lives and die young in most cases
-   [[Yu Xiaomei]] possessed extraordinary talent and did not die suddenly. With the guidance of [[Fire Dragon Immortal]], she finally achieved complete success by regulating the fiery power. However, her internal organs were already damaged, leading to endless troubles. Every time she practiced, she would feel as if her heart was burning, experiencing unbearable pain. This not only shortened her lifespan but also posed a risk of sudden death. She could not engage in real combat at all. Therefore, [[Yu Xiaomei|Xiaomei]] never used Heartburn Seal in combat.
