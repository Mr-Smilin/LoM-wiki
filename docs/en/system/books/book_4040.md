The meaning of "阿摩" is unknown to anyone, not even the senior masters of the Beggar Sect or the scholars at the Gengyang Study Room.
<br><br>
However, "搪牆" is interpreted as "smearing." In other words, this fist technique is a martial art that can achieve its maximum effectiveness in extremely narrow spaces: pushing the enemy against the wall and relentlessly striking until they are reduced to a pulp smeared on the wall.
<br><br>
Although the concept is simple, this martial art cannot be established without a solid foundation in external skills. "Cun Jin," "Dun Zhou," and "Tie Shan Kao" are all practical combat techniques.
