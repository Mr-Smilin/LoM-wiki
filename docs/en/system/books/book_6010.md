The extremely insane sword technique was created by a third-rate swordsman who harbored deep hatred for his wife's murderer.
<br><br>
During his unjust 13-year imprisonment, he imagined his enemies' martial arts techniques thousands of times in his heart and tortured his wife's killer tens of thousands of times in his mind.
<br><br>
Shortly after his release from prison, the shocking bloodbath case known as "Bloody Massacre" erupted in the martial world.
