One of the renowned hard skills of the Songshan Sect, based on the foundation of stake-kicking. Practitioners tie sandbags to their legs and take turns kicking the wooden stake a hundred times in one session. Beginners start by kicking three sessions a day, morning, noon, and night. As their skills deepen, kicking ten or twenty sessions a day becomes routine.
<br><br>
After a hundred days, without the sandbags, the legs are agile and powerful as before, the foundation has been established. Further practice involves techniques such as bouncing, kicking, stomping, smashing, swinging, pointing, lifting, and sweeping, the eight leg techniques, each capable of capturing the opponent.
