The martial arts created by your senior brother of the Tang Sect, recorded in the sequel to Ascend Clouds Ladder.
<br><br>
In order to meet a beauty, one can ascend the clouds to reach the tower. Among them, the Moon Treading Style is a combat move derived from this light skill, with "moon" referring to brilliance, symbolizing all weapons imposed on oneself.
<br><br>
Therefore, the true meaning of the Moon Treading Style is specifically stepping on others' weapons, looking down on them and stepping on their faces.

## Acquisition Method

-   Study abroad at the Kunlun Sect for two years and apprentice under [[Xiahou Lan]]. Practice in the Soul-stealing Forest.

## Notes

-   Written by [[Xiahou Lan]], combining the "Ascend Clouds Tread" of [[Tang Buyi|Senior Brother]] and the "Plum Blossom Moon-viewing Step" of the Snow Mountain Sect.
