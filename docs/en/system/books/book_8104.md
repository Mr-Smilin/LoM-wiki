The Tangmen ancestral medical book is the only medical book in the world that uses poison as medicine.
<br><br>
It combines the Miaojiang and Buddhist teachings, observing that a bowl of water contains eighty-four thousand insects, with insects representing poison, corresponding to the five elements and six combinations, matching the five viscera and six bowels. Excessive leads to harm, scarcity leads to illness, complete leads to weakness, and errors lead to madness.
<br><br>
Humans are not immune to the five poisons, but rather the toxicity has not yet manifested. Only by nourishing it with medicine can it be made to follow the heart and not resist, using the body's poison for one's own benefit, making it difficult for various illnesses to invade.

## Notes

- The original pharmacopoeia has been lost, and this book is a miscellaneous note written by [[Tang Zheng|Second Senior Brother]] based on the principles of poison classics, combining external elixir methods, medical principles, and personal experiences. Even if disciples from other families read it, they are not bound by the sect rules.
