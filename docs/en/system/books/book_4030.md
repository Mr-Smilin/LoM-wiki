It has become a common practice among the members of the Beggar Gang to use spectacular escape techniques when in a large group. They disperse in all directions, making it difficult for enemies to capture them all at once. Eventually, there will always be someone who can escape and deliver the message back home.
<br><br>
This escape technique is passed down in the form of a song, which goes: "Watching the east while running west, nowhere to escape but up a tree, groups of three to five, iron without mercy, life and death are predetermined, don't delay." Although the lyrics are simple and crude, they not only contain deceptive elements but also prepare for the possibility of being caught in advance.
