The Beggar Sect is skilled in the Snake Fist technique. The Snake Fist of the Beggar Sect is not just about imitating the movements of a snake, but actually fighting alongside snakes. Every punch and kick must be coordinated with the movements of a snake. In addition to pecking, entwining, and seizing techniques, there is also a hidden killer move. When this move is executed, it becomes a fatal strike - catching the opponent off guard with a sudden snake-like attack!
