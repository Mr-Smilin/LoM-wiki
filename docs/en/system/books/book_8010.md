Nangong Ancestor, the handwritten copy of Nangong Zhi, the leader of the martial arts world. The strokes are vigorous, each stroke as if sweeping through a thousand troops, often used by the Nangong family to practice calligraphy.
<br><br>
Although it does not record martial arts, it contains various insights of Nangong Zhi's life, including military strategy, knowledge, medical skills, life experiences, contemporary fashion, and jokes.
<br><br>
In fact, this book is quite interesting.
