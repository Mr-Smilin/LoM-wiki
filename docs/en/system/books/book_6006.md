The renowned unique skill of the ancestor of the Emei Sect, White Ape Patriarch, strictly speaking, can also be considered a form of Monkey Fist, but it differs greatly from the popular Monkey Fist passed down among the common people. The power originates from the back, passing through the shoulders, elbows, and reaching the fingertips, known as Reaching Arm.
