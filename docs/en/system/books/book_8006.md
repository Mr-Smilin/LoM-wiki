The Chronicles of the Ghost Realm is an anonymous victim's plea written with a pen instead of hands.
<br><br>
It narrates how he went from an innocent and healthy child to being deceived, losing his family, wandering in a foreign land, struggling to survive, only to be framed for theft and imprisoned, leading to the amputation of both arms.
<br><br>
In the end, he escaped and sought revenge using the nail training he endured in prison.
