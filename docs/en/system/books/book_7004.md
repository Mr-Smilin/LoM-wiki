Military drills of the loyal Yang family in the Northern Song Dynasty.
<br><br>
Although called drills, in order to truly improve survival rates on the battlefield, the intensity of this drill not only far exceeds that of the imperial regular army, but is even stricter than the martial arts of small sects in the martial arts world, incorporating staff drills, One Hundred and Eight Array drills, and Eighteen Strikes of the Bronze Hammer. Even in the martial arts world, few can endure this set of drills.
