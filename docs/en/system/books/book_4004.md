One of the seven famous skills of the martial arts leader, the great hero Dragon Abyss.
<br><br>
Xuan Xuan Ru Yi Finger, a skillful technique that allows one to catch weapons with bare hands, explore people's belongings, and be unbeatable in any situation.
<br><br>
When Dragon Abyss was young, he often used this skill to steal money from others, until he realized his potential and shouldered the fate of the martial arts world, removing the thieving techniques from the secret manual.
