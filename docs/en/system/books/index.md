## Settings

-   Niaoxiong believes that rumors are more terrifying than martial arts; the fear of people's words. [^1]
-   Each sect has their own characteristics and beliefs, which are reflected in their martial arts. [^1]
-   Most martial arts do not have a rigid connection with internal strength; those that require matching internal strength are actually in the minority. [^2]
-   Not all martial artists have muscular bodies; some schools believe that muscles can affect speed and emphasize balanced development. [^3]
-   It's not always the case that the one with higher martial arts skills wins a fight; even the ultimate [[Zhao Huo]] could be caught off guard and pushed down the stairs by [[Xiaomei]]. [^3]
