The lightness and leg techniques of the Quanzhen Sect, known as "Lightness and Leg Techniques," originated from the book of Zhuangzi and are also found in ancient qin music.
<br><br>
During their daily practice, disciples of the Quanzhen Sect are accompanied by their master playing music. They transform into giant fish, soar like a roc, move the heavens and earth, rise to the blue sky, support the rotation of the stars, control the cold wind, adapt to the northern seas, dominate all things, and soar through the vast and the nine stages of music before concluding their practice.
