A mystical martial art, the author's name has been lost to history.
<br><br>
It combines both palm techniques and sword techniques, where there is no sword in hand, but a sword in the heart.
<br><br>
The moves are exquisite, yet devoid of any killing intent, seemingly only for self-amusement, like a bright moon dancing in the sky, exhilarating and refreshing.
