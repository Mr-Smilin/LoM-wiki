The renowned Nangong family's martial arts may seem elegant with just a paper fan in hand, but it is far from ordinary.
<br><br>
Their fan techniques combine offense and defense, with the fan handle used for striking acupoints. The fan's movements are deceptive, with hidden attacks that can catch opponents off guard. Skilled practitioners can use the wind generated by the fan to strike, making it difficult to defend against. What sets them apart is their scholarly demeanor, humble and harmonious.
