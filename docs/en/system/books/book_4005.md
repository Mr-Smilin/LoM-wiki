An ancient finger technique, written in Sanskrit, hidden deep beneath the scripture pavilion, unlikely to see the light of day unless an earthquake occurs.
<br><br>
"Na Mo Ta" represents the numerical concept in Buddhism, meaning "countless".
<br><br>
"Jie" is the general term for time in Tianzhu. After going through the stages of formation, abiding, destruction, and emptiness, it constitutes a great cycle. Therefore, to practice this technique, one must comprehend the essence of Zen, neither arising nor ceasing, enduring countless cycles with the physical body, only then can one realize the great path.
