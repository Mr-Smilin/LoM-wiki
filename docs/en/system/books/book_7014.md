## Acquisition Method

Strong Fish Selling Event - Help Xu Dajing win Fuyun and then buy it for $500, or choose "I can't afford it" and win by force

## Notes

- Secret technique of the Shangguan Family
- Specializes in causing chaos, particularly effective against lightness skills, combined with the Wave-Cutting Sword Technique, one wave after another
- The image is from the Eight Wastelands Escape, likely for illustrative purposes (v1.0.3131)
