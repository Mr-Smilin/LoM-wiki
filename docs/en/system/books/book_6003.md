The legendary martial arts of the Kongtong Sect's Feitian Gate.
<br><br>
With agile footwork and fast punches, it is known for its agility and versatility. Sometimes strolling leisurely, sometimes launching sudden attacks, making it unpredictable and difficult to defend against.
<br><br>
However, this boxing technique is overly complex, consisting of thirty-six forms, seventy-two variations, and one hundred and eight follow-up moves, making it difficult to master. As a result, few people in the Feitian Gate delve deeply into its study.
