The stolen boxing classics from the Songshan Temple are the foundation of Songshan martial arts, easy to learn but difficult to master.
<br><br>
The Luohan Fist manual circulating among the people has evolved into many routines over hundreds of years, each with its own style. Each manual is slightly different, and you don't even know if the one in your hand is the original version. If you happen to pick up this manual, you have a connection with the Buddha, so practice it.
