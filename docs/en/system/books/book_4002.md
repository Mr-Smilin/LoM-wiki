Originally known as "Wind and Thunder Divine Kick," it was the renowned skill of the handsome swordsman "Wind God" Xie Wuchen, who excelled in leg techniques. Unfortunately, during a challenge against the Hungry Ghost Daoist King Liu Ya, he was publicly humiliated by the "Violating Sword" technique. Enraged, Xie Wuchen vomited blood in defeat and was forced to rename the skill "Very Forceful Kick."
<br><br>
The Very Forceful Kick is extremely fierce when executed, with swift speed akin to wind and thunder, capable of shattering rocks and dominating all in its path, truly formidable.
