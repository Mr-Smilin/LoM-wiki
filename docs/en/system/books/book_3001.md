Named after Song Taizu Zhao Kuangyin, emphasizing practical combat offense and defense, with strict routines and agile footwork.
<br><br>
The body movements resemble a cat, the shaking akin to a tiger, the steps like a swimming dragon, and the actions as swift as lightning.
<br><br>
Although bearing the name of Taizu, it is actually the Songshan Fist technique.
