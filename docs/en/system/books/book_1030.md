The classic hard qigong of the Songshan Sect, the specialty skill of the eighteen bronze men of the Songshan Temple.
<br><br>
Golden Bell Cover focuses on both internal and external training, strengthening the muscles and bones externally, and solidifying the internal organs. Those who have mastered this skill have bodies like bronze and iron, and even when subjected to punches and kicks, they feel nothing.
