Written by the Confucian swordsman Mr. Zeng Wen, summarizing the Four Books, Five Classics, and Thirteen Classics, discussing how a gentleman should be cautious in solitude, manifesting from the heart to the body, from knowledge to etiquette, neither arrogant nor humble, with words and actions in harmony. The changing of the moon and stars is beyond your control, the rise and fall of mountains and rivers follow their own course, but I will stay true to my heart and cultivate myself.
<br><br>
No matter how good the world may be, I am still just myself; no matter how corrupt the world may be, I am still just myself. Discarding this mortal body, it remains the same.
<br><br>
For those who practice swordsmanship and martial arts, they should uphold their true nature, using the sharpness of the sword as a mirror, not ashamed to ask and seek within themselves, remaining humble yet self-improving constantly, facing difficulties without worry, being vigilant during leisure, and fearless in the presence of the powerful. This is the way of the gentleman's sword.
