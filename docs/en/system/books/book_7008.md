> By touching like striking a string, the sound resonates in the veins, its sound lasting for a long time without fading.

Practitioners need to stand on one leg, using their leg to support the pipa. This is the light skill "Crane Stance" of the Feitian Sect; to pluck the strings of the iron piano, one must first practice the "Frost Knife Breaking Bamboo Finger" of the Duopo Sect; to resonate the soundbox, one must utilize the internal energy of the Xuangong Sect to make it vibrate; when facing enemies, one can even pick up the pipa as a weapon, using the Iron Fist Sect's "As You Wish Smash" move to smash the enemy's head open.
<br><br>
With a single thought upon completion of the skill, all veins resonate together, moving like a vibrating string, lasting for a long time without fading, making it the top divine skill of the Kongtong Sect.
