<BookItemIcon :size="`medium`" :needLink="false" :no="8105" :style="'float: right;'" />

A collection of outstanding contemporary literati's Song Ci selected by Wei Ju, excerpting one hundred Song Ci, with balanced reasoning and mirror-like accuracy.
<br><br>
Not all recorded works are necessarily from famous masters, but they are all masterpieces.
<br><br>
This book is handwritten by Wei Ju, with elegant handwriting, like a beautiful woman adorning flowers, and like a phoenix soaring, unable to achieve her ambitions. However, every literati and elegant scholar who sees this volume cannot help but be ecstatic, except for you, a person of the Jianghu.
<br><br>
She strictly adheres to her oath, but hides a bit of selfishness, collecting her own old works under the identity of "Anonymous."
