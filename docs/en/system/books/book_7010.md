The Snow Mountain Sect's lost heart technique had a very unique method of practice.
<br><br>
One must absorb sufficient true qi, strip naked, and insert their head into the snow with only their feet exposed. Another person would then use moxibustion on the soles of the feet to stimulate the Yongquan acupoint, allowing the practitioner to utilize the heat from the moxibustion to warm the meridians and regulate body temperature to resist the cold.
<br><br>
If there is no snow available, finding a cool stream nearby can serve as a substitute.
