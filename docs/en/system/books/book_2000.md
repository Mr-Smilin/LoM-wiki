Created by the former hero Lei Zhan from the previous dynasty, with a domineering name and powerful techniques, each move is bold and grand, as if there is the momentum of thunder striking from the ninth heaven. When executing the knife, it is also accompanied by a loud shout, breaking through the enemy's protective energy.
