A combined technique developed by the Kunlun and Tangmen martial arts couples during their secluded cultivation.
<br><br>
One person uses fist, the other uses sword, complementing each other, like the harmony of a musical instrument, the more their intentions align, the stronger the power.

You have the secret technique, but lack a partner.
