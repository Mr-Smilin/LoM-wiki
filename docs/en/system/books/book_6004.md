The unique claw technique created by the infamous mysterious thief Iron Face Man.
<br><br>
Deviating from conventional logic, he walks a different path, lurking in the darkness, transforming into a shadow, striking with a deadly blow.
<br><br>
Commissioned by Pang Taishi, Iron Face Man intended to assassinate Bao Zheng, but his heart was moved by Bao's selfless spirit and integrity, unwilling to commit private murder against the heavens. He dared not betray his trust, thus abandoning his advantage, secretly challenging the Southern Hero Zhang Zhao. Defeated in a fair fight, he severed his own fingers, and Bao Zheng pardoned him.
<br><br>
Iron Face Man retired to Kongtong, where he had a set of iron claw prosthetic hands made and wrote this book.
