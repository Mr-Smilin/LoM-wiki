During his travels through the states, the Confucian God of War Mengzi engaged in verbal battles with heroes, using his sharp tongue and eloquence to pacify the Central Plains. The origin of these quotes is unknown, but in rural legends, the "cannon" in chess actually refers to Mengzi's mouth, capable of killing from a distance with terrifying accuracy.
<br><br>
Regardless of the opponent's status or respectful attitude, Mengzi would mercilessly teach them a lesson. He even incorporated Sun Tzu's Art of War and internal energy into arguments, leaving people speechless and even risking death from his verbal assaults.
<br><br>
While he criticized all the schools of thought, he did not allow others to criticize him, angrily retorting, "Am I fond of arguing!? I have no choice!!" This phrase has echoed through the ages.
