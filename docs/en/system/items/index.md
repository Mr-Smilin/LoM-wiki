        <td>Usually for saving money, maintaining morality, and optimal mental affinity recovery. When mental affinity is low (sad face, below 34), folding paper once can fully restore it, but food may not be useless. Cannot fold paper after leaving Tangmen.
<br>Additionally, if you want to change your sweetheart (when sweetheart is not Little Junior Sister), you can fold paper in the room to increase change points. If it's high enough, it will trigger a dream event.</td>
