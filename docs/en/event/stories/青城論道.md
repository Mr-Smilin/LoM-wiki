# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

More than twenty years ago, the Kongtong Sect's [Fire Dragon Immortal Lord](/people/characters/special204), the Quanzhen Sect's [Qiu Chuji](/people/characters/special209), [Hao Datong](/people/characters/other4), the Qingcheng Sect's [Zou Bo](/people/characters/special201), and [Zhao Kui](/people/characters/special403) once gathered together to discuss the classics and Taoism.
<br><br>
During the debate, Sect Leader Zou and Daoist Master Hao had a very pleasant conversation and felt an instant connection. Sect Leader Zou then imparted his talismanic spells to Daoist Master Hao, who in return shared the essence of alchemy.
<br><br>
The Fire Dragon Immortal Lord misinterpreted the classics, explained them arbitrarily, and used Taoist knowledge to show off and intimidate others. Zhao Kui was greatly influenced by him, and later his Dao heart sank and he fell into the practice of the Hell Dao King. Zou Bo was itching with hatred. If it weren't for Quanzhen's Qiu Real Person and the Southern Palace Old Lady's persuasion, with his fiery temper when he was young, he would have already gone to Kongtong to challenge and kill people.
