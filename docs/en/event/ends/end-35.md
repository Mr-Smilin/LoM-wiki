## Divergence and Changes

### Bonding Objects

Different endings and impacts on the legendary text based on the bonded objects.

-   <Girl8Icon>Long Xiang</Girl8Icon>: Both protagonist and her die in battle.
-   <Girl0Icon>Tang Mo Ling</Girl0Icon>: Super heart-wrenching <Girl0Icon>Junior Sister</Girl0Icon> survives alone.
-   <Girl5Icon>Xiahou Lan</Girl5Icon>: Depending on whether [[Fan Xiaotian]] becomes her disciple, two storylines exist, affecting the legendary text.
    -   [[Fan Xiaotian]] becomes <Girl5Icon>Xiahou Lan</Girl5Icon>'s disciple: Carries the protagonist's body back to the snow mountain for burial, then disappears after [[Fan Xiaotian|Fan Xieyan]] gets married.
    -   Not meeting the above condition: Carries the protagonist's body back to the snow mountain for burial, guarding the grave for life.

<br>※Priority of bonding in the Generously Sacrifice ending (v1.0.3201.1): <Girl8Icon>Long Xiang</Girl8Icon> > <Girl4Icon>Shangguan Ying</Girl4Icon> > <Girl3Icon>Yu Xiaomei</Girl3Icon> > <Girl6Icon>Yu Zhu</Girl6Icon> > <Girl0Icon>Tang Mo Ling</Girl0Icon> > <Girl2Icon>Ye Yunshang</Girl2Icon> > <Girl7Icon>Wei Ju</Girl7Icon> > <Girl5Icon>Xiahou Lan</Girl5Icon>

### Concerned Objects

If there are no bonded objects, the dying character will think of the concerned object before death, without affecting the legendary text.

### Joining Tang Sect Members

-   [[Ye Yunzhou]]: To be confirmed.
-   [[Fan Xiaotian]]: Needs to not bond with <Girl8Icon>Long Xiang</Girl8Icon>, <Girl4Icon>Shangguan Ying</Girl4Icon>, <Girl3Icon>Yu Xiaomei</Girl3Icon>, <Girl6Icon>Yu Zhu</Girl6Icon>, and not have [[Fan Xiaotian]] become <Girl5Icon>Xiahou Lan</Girl5Icon>'s disciple, resulting in additional death storyline, without affecting the legendary text.

### Blue Sword Ghost of Ye Yunshang

(Inference) If <Girl2Icon>Ye Yunshang</Girl2Icon> remains in Tang Sect but dies, the transformed Blue Sword Ghost [[Ye Yunzhou]] will arrive and die.
※Requires not bonding with <Girl8Icon>Long Xiang</Girl8Icon>, <Girl4Icon>Shangguan Ying</Girl4Icon>, <Girl3Icon>Yu Xiaomei</Girl3Icon>, <Girl6Icon>Yu Zhu</Girl6Icon>

### Failure to Reconcile with Feishi Gang

Details to be confirmed.
※Requires not bonding with <Girl8Icon>Long Xiang</Girl8Icon>, <Girl4Icon>Shangguan Ying</Girl4Icon>, <Girl3Icon>Yu Xiaomei</Girl3Icon>, <Girl6Icon>Yu Zhu</Girl6Icon>
