## Divergence and Changes

No discoveries.

## Notes

-   The inspiration comes from the dragon's desire to enter the sea, so departure is also related to the sea. [^1]
-   [[Long Yuan]] was not present at the time, as he was not always idle and had nothing to do at the back mountain of Tang Sect. [^1]
