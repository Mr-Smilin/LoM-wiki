<EndBackground no=23 title="Rise and Fall in the Officialdom">
You learn the art of officialdom, facing flattery from above and ruthlessness from below. Even if you have an ugly appearance, as long as your power is great enough, no one dares to speak ill of you. However, whether those who remain silent like cicadas, or those old friends from the rivers and lakes who never come to visit you, look down on you in their hearts, that is hard to say.
