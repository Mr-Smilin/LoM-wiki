## Conditions and Process

<b>Conditions:</b> The gift for the Nangong family's birthday banquet follows the advice of the eldest brother, [Tang Buyi](/people/characters/brother1) with affection <35, cultivation <40 [irritable, insane].<br>
<b>Process:</b><br>

1. In early October of the first year, during the Tang Clan meeting to decide on the gift for the Nangong family's birthday banquet, the advice of the eldest brother is determined by spinning the dice.
2. During the banquet, when the eldest brother invites you to come on stage to perform a cross talk, choose to retire from the world (this option requires Tang Buyi's affection <35, cultivation <40 [irritable, insane].)
