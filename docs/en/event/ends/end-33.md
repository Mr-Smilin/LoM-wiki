<b>Process:</b><br>

1. When there is only one action left in early December of the third year, the decision of [[the crowd]] will lead to the **Western Martial Arts Alliance** storyline.

3. There are various combinations in the middle process, most of which do not affect the outcome, except for special requirements when the following conditions are met:
    - If the [[Martial Arts Convention]] does not support the Jinxiang Palace, and [[Danxiazi]] does not join the Tang Sect, and **ðŸ“– Choice: Close the Gate** is made, an inner strength of â‰¥20 and a temperament of â‰¥20 are required.
        - Furthermore, if still bonded with <Girl5Icon>Xiahou Lan</Girl5Icon>, a victory is needed in the duel with [[Wanlipengcheng]].
4. The outcome of the first battle has no impact, choosing **ðŸ“– Choice: Defend the Outer Stronghold with All Strength** will lead to the ending after losing the battle.
