<EndBackground no=21 title="Retiring from the World">
You sheathed your sword and retired, never engaging in combat with others again, living to the end of your days. Occasionally, some people were friendly to you, but many others inexplicably disliked you, harbored enmity towards you, and mocked you. Malice was everywhere, even beyond the realm of rivers and lakes; such is the nature of the world.
