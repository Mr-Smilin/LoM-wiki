<EndBackground no=43 title="Falling Out of Favor">
After having a child, Xiahou Lan's cold heart finally melted, and you fell out of favor. She focused on taking care of the family and children, often feeling fortunate that the child resembled her and not you. She also did not allow you to scold the child, excessively spoiling them. In order for the child to receive a good education, one day she went out and captured Wei Ju to serve as a tutor at home.
