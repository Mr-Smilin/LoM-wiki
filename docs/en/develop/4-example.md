This page will provide you with collaboration templates,  
and the bare minimum of basic tutorials,  
dedicated to all of you who love to explore and contribute.

## Templates Ready for Use

:::info
Simply "copy" and "paste" the template to the desired location,  
"rename" it, and you're good to go.

Avoid directly "modifying," "deleting," "renaming," or "moving" page templates to prevent unexpected issues for others.

## Recommended Knowledge for Project Participation (Recommended Completion Order)

1. Choose between Html or md (markdown)  
   Html learning resource: [W3C Html](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)  
   md learning resource: [Markdown Syntax Guide](https://markdown.tw)

::: tip  
When dealing with complex tables, both html and md may be used simultaneously,<br>
while for simple tables, either one will suffice.<br>
We will improve and simplify this entry barrier, but it will take time to develop,<br>
hoping to enable more people to quickly get started.
