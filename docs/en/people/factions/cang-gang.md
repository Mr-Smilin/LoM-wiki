As one of the three major gangs, Cang Gang is the arm of the [[Shangguan Family]], dominating the coastal areas of Fujian. They prevent the commoners from making a living, as a grass carp can be sold for two hundred or three hundred wen.
<br><br>
The disciples of Cang Gang practice martial arts to combat the harassment of the [[White Shark Gang]] pirates. Whether they can be considered martial artists is hard to say. Many gang members were recruited by [[Shangguan Ying]], and in the eyes of the gang members, their status is even higher than that of the gang leader. They are willing to go through fire and water, following her wherever she goes, just to earn money and settle down.

## Martial Arts Techniques

- [[Wave-Cutting Sword Technique]]

## Notes

- The name of the leader of Cang Gang is unknown, not [[Shangguan Jun]].
- The organizational structure of Cang Gang is unclear, only briefly mentioning one of the Five Incense Masters, Zhu Wu of the Nine Immortals Hall, who directly serves the head of the Shangguan family.
- Before [[Shangguan Jun]] retired, he saw Cang Gang monopolizing and oppressing the village, so he carried the Golden Dragon King Blade and killed the core members of Cang Gang. It is possible that this was when Cang Gang came under his command.
- [[Xu Da Jing]] was once a member of Cang Gang.
