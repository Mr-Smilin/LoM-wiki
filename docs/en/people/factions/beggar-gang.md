The largest gang in the world, with tens of thousands of members, all beggars, with branches everywhere.

<br>

The higher the number of pockets on a beggar's clothes, the higher their status. Only disciples with six pockets or more can receive martial arts teachings from the elder. Other beggars are skilled in various deceptive tricks, such as lime powder, sweat-inducing medicine, feces, releasing snakes, releasing dogs, challenging anyone without regard for a righteous image.

<br>

To beg for food, they engage in theft, robbery, kidnapping, and other crimes, resembling rogues disguised as beggars. It wasn't until the rise of [[Wang Erzhuang]] and his advocacy for chivalry and righteousness that these bad habits were prohibited, leading to improvements.

<br>

Actually a branch of the [[Mud Sect]].

## Conflict between New and Old Factions

The Beggar's Sect is divided into new and old factions. The new faction is led by the current leader, [[Wang Erzhuang]], advocating for chivalry and righteousness. The old faction consists of the previous generation of beggars, known for their malicious and filthy behavior, far from the ideals of chivalry and righteousness.

<br>

The old faction used to engage in all sorts of evil deeds until [[Wang Erzhuang]] struck down the old faction's elder, [[Qian Jinsou]], at a Beggar's Sect meeting. He recognized [[Li Fugui]], the orphan left behind, as his adopted son, leading the new faction disciples to rise and sweep away the sect's previous bad practices. The promotion of chivalry and righteousness turned the Beggar's Sect from black to white. The old faction, while criticizing the new faction as deviant, continued to enjoy the reputation earned by the new faction.

<br>

Later, [[Wang Erzhuang|Leader Wang]] gathered the five major branches of Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, Wisdom, and Trust to attack Jiangling City, revealing his identity as the [[Mud Sect|King of the Beastly Path]]. This action aimed to foster cooperation between the court and the martial world, balancing the relationship between them. The old faction feigned illness to avoid battle, resulting in most casualties being from the new faction. In the end, [[Li Fugui]] upheld justice by eliminating his own relatives and became the new leader, reinstating the old faction elders who then seized power, suppressing the new faction.

<br>

Originally, according to Leader Wang's plan, after [[Li Fugui]] became the leader, he would restrain the old faction, mediate between the new and old factions, and wait until all the elders passed away to unify the Beggar's Sect. However, unexpected events unfolded, with the death of [[Nan Gongyuan]], the head of the Nan Gong family, leaving no one to protect the [[Tang Sect]]. If the court destroyed the Tang Sect, the situation would collapse, and no one would dare to resist the court. Once the nobles acted without restraint, the beggars' good days would be over.

<br>

If [[Li Fugui]] had a high enough favorability rating, on the eve of the Wulin Alliance's attack, he would visit the [[Tang Sect]] with a proposal crafted by Leader Wang and Madame Wen: the establishment of the Western Wulin Alliance. He would act as a hostage at the Tang Sect to restrain the Beggar's Sect, inciting conflict between the new and old factions, keeping the Wulin Alliance busy mediating and buying time to recruit more forces.

<br>

Ultimately, the new and old factions split, with the old faction elders having wider influence and receiving support from the Wulin Alliance, while the new faction lacked leadership until [[Li Fugui]] emerged to enforce discipline and support the Tang Sect.

## Branches

The Beggar's Sect has branches spread across various regions, including the following known branches:

- Da Ren: Located in Jiangling Prefecture, old faction, previously caused trouble in Anji Alley.
- Da Zhi: Located near the [[Jinxiang Palace]], likely in Hunan.
- Da Yi: Located in Sichuan, new faction, details to follow.
- Da Xin: Location unknown.
- Da Yong: Located in the south.
- Da Li: Location unknown.

### Da Yi Branch

Known for their sense of righteousness and the best relationship with the [[Tang Sect]], often causing trouble and enjoying hotpot together. During heavy rainstorms, when the market sells vegetables and fruits at low prices, both sides would fight to get the best deals, then reconcile and the winner would treat the loser to a meal.

<br>

In a hopeless situation, [[Li Fugui|Leader Li]] would promote the Da Yi branch leader to the head of the main branch as an elder, essentially a demotion to sideline their power and surveillance, relocating the Da Yi branch beggars to Jiangling Prefecture as reinforcements for the Xiangyang anti-Jin battlefront.

<br>

In the Western Wulin scenario, sending [[Tang Weiyuan|Fourth Brother Tang]] to persuade the Da Yi branch, it was discovered that the new branch leader was a spy sent by the Beggar's Sect elders to supervise the Da Yi branch. Depending on the outcome, the Da Yi branch would either be wiped out by the lurking Da Ren branch or exposed, leading to their relocation to an outpost and becoming non-family disciples of the Tang Sect.

## Notes

- The Beggar's Sect also practices poison, although their poison skills are rough compared to the [[Tang Sect]], they still have an eye for discerning poisons.
- The Beggar's Sect's ultimate skill, the Snake Scaring Staff, is mastered by [[Li Fugui]], a nightmare for players.
- Unity of man and sword? Unity of man and dog!
