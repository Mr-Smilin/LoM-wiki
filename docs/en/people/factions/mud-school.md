The Mud Sect is so named for two reasons. [^1]

<br>

Firstly, the Mud Sect believes that the human world is like a muddy swamp, where all living beings are born into suffering and find it hard to escape. Although the followers of the Quanzhen Sect are numerous, none have truly ascended and left the worldly troubles behind. Instead of placing their hopes in metaphysical teachings, the Mud Sect advocates for living well, even if it means struggling in the mud like in a swamp. The six Path Kings each preside over their respective paths, representing six different ways of living.

<br>

Secondly, they discovered a mud hot spring in the Liudao Gorge, which the followers love to soak in, covering their whole bodies in mud.

<br>

People in the martial world find the members of the Mud Sect suspicious, as they soak in mud and recite forbidden scriptures. With disturbances caused by the Hungry Ghost Path and Hell Path, they are seen as a new demonic sect following the Blissful Sect.

<br clear="all">

## Six Paths of Reincarnation

The six paths of the Mud Sect are Heaven, Asura, Human, Hell, Animal, and Hungry Ghost. The Three Good Paths and Three Evil Paths represent the Buddhist concept of the six paths of reincarnation. Beings in the six paths govern themselves differently, with some living peacefully and others engaging in various evils.

<br>

The Heavenly Path King, [[Che Xuanyuan]], resides deep in the Liudao Gorge.

<br>

The Asura Path King remains unknown, with his followers hidden among the Song army. They collaborated with the Animal Path during the siege of Jiangling, causing chaos, but their actions were soon exposed. With their power fragmented, they scattered in all directions. [^3]

<br>

The Human Path King, incarnated as [[Jinxiang Palace]], shelters women without support, earning a good reputation in the martial world. However, at the Fengyu Mountain Assembly, they were exposed by [[Nangong Jian]], leading to the deaths of the Human Path King, Lady Wen, and [[Nangong Yuan]].

<br>

The Hell Path King, [[Zhao Kui]], often appears mysteriously in the western Shu region, wreaking havoc without regard for laws. When his thousands of ghost soldiers swarm out, it is like the gates of hell opening in July. Capturing people everywhere, they bring them back to the "Underworld" for interrogation, causing harm to both the righteous and the wicked.

<br>

The Animal Path King, [[Wang Erzhuang]], hides within the New Faction of the Beggar's Sect. They uphold justice and are highly respected by the people in the city, until they suddenly turn hostile during the siege of Jiangling, colluding with the Asura Path and catching everyone off guard. Ultimately, the Animal Path King is killed by [[Li Fugui]], leading to a resurgence of the old faction of the Beggar's Sect.

<br>

The Hungry Ghost Path, represented by the [[White Shark Gang]], roams the East Sea and has conflicts with the [[Shangguan Family]] and the court. The Hungry Ghost Path King, [[Liu E]], is currently the most wanted pirate hunter, with a bounty even higher than the Heavenly Throne. Despite multiple attempts by the court to eliminate the pirates at sea, their base remains unknown to this day.

## Five-Colored Mud

Members of the Mud Sect sometimes heal villagers, with the most famous medicine being the Five-Colored Mud, which carries a lotus fragrance and can cure various illnesses. Those without ailments who consume it can extend their lifespan.

<br>

This medicine is similar to the Ten Thousand Spirit Oil of the [[Tang Sect]], but the Ten Thousand Spirit Pill uses poison as a method, which can be harmful if consumed by someone not poisoned. The Five-Colored Mud, on the other hand, can be used externally to stop bleeding and internally for nourishment and health benefits, making it a miraculous medicine that combines ancient and modern medical practices for the benefit of society.

<br>

However, this medicine is considered poison to members of the [[Tang Sect]], who rely on toxic tonics to cultivate their inner energy day and night, making them essentially poisonous. Accidentally consuming this medicine could lead to a dispersion of their internal energy.

## Secret Techniques

- [[Blood Book of Wars]]
- [[Warming Yang and Activating Blood Talisman]]

## Notes

- According to the [[Warming Yang and Activating Blood Talisman]], and considering that the Mud Sect's physician comes from the Liudao Gorge, it is possible that the Heavenly Path King has medical knowledge. ~~Learning medicine cannot save the Great Song Empire~~
- As described in the [[Blood Book of Wars]], the Asura Path King is likely a general on the battlefield, a divine protector of the Great Song Empire.
- At the Fengyu Mountain Assembly, [[Shi Ming]] falsely accused the [[Tang Sect]] of being the Asura Path, with [[Tang Zhongling]] being the Asura Path King, but it was all a misunderstanding.
- The original plan of [[Rui Xing|Apricot Blossom Fairy]] was to have the Mud Sect, after the Animal Path, destroy the Hell Path, Heavenly Path, Hungry Ghost Path, and finally the Human Path, but the Human Path encountered trouble first. However, from this statement, it can be inferred that in the Apricot Blossom Fairy's mind, the Asura Path had already been considered destroyed.
- Each of the six major sects has subordinates, and Bird Bear suggests that the Mud Sect may also have them, but you just don't know. Their subordinates might look very ordinary, but their strategies and martial arts skills are top-notch. [^2]
- Although [[Liu E]] has visited the Jinxiang Palace, Heavenly Path, and Hell Path, not all Path Kings have spent time in each major path. [^3]
