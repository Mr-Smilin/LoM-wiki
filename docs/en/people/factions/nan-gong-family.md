</InfoList>

The Nangong Family is located in Jiangling Prefecture, known as the "heart of the martial world" and a mediator in the martial arts community. They are known for their fairness and justice, with the aspiration of great unity. As a prominent martial arts family, they are also well-versed in literature, producing top martial scholars and martial arts alliance leaders. With a wide network of connections, they have weathered the storms of the martial world and stood tall for centuries. The name of Nangong is renowned throughout the martial world, and it is said that offending the Nangong Family is akin to offending eighty percent of the martial world.
<br><br>
Members of the family wear shoulder armor and cloaks, exuding an imposing presence that is their pride and proof of their individuality. They even have crescent-shaped spikes on their belts, making them quite intimidating.
<br><br>
The Nangong family is known for their long-standing defensive tactics, with the [[Nangong Flowing Fan|Flowing Fan Technique]] combining offense and defense, embodying Confucian virtues of humility and harmony. They practice internal martial arts, focusing on protecting the heart, guarding the mind, and achieving unity with all things. It is rumored that even at the age of one hundred, [[Nangong Heng|Grand Patriarch Nangong]] remains sharp and methodical, a testament to the effectiveness of the [[Nangong Heart Protection Technique]].
<br><br>
They have a friendly relationship with the [[Tang Sect]], but tensions with the [[Jinxiang Palace]] run high due to a past incident involving Nangong Yuan and Lady Wen.

## Shoulder Armor

This tradition began with the Nangong Family's ancestor, Nangong Zhi, for two main reasons.
<br><br>
Firstly, during the Battle of Bianjing, to intimidate the Jin army, they needed to showcase their strength. The exaggerated shoulder armor was designed to be visible from afar, instilling fear in the enemy.
<br><br>
Secondly, it was a hindrance. Both the shoulder armor and cloak were cumbersome in combat, hindering both the wearer and the opponent. When enemies found the shoulder armor troublesome, they would target areas without armor protection. By withholding attacks, they could limit the opponent's options and lead them to use predictable techniques. Understanding one's opponent leads to victory in battle.
<br><br>
[[Tang Buyi|Fei Xia]] does not support shoulder armor, as it poses a risk when performing light-footed movements, potentially causing dangerous collisions.
<br><br>
Shoulder armor is imposing and prevents uncouth martial artists from getting too close, maintaining a polite social distance. However, due to the risk of bumping into doors, the Nangong Family often keeps their doors wide open, displaying generosity. [^2]
<br><br>
Nangong family women have the authority to modify their shoulder armor, but the size and materials used are determined by their status. Non-family women using gold will be reprimanded. Additionally, if a Nangong clan member is expelled, their shoulder armor will be confiscated. [^2]

### Phoenix Robe

A hundred years ago, Nangong Zhi created the invincible battle armor, the Phoenix Robe, to intimidate the Jin army. There is a chance to see [[Nangong Shen]] wearing it in the Western martial arts line. It is extravagant, awe-inspiring, impervious to blades and spears, and can even breathe fire. It is so exaggerated that one cannot help but question the sanity of the Nangong family, with even a dedicated background music!
Supporters of shoulder armor would be terrified at the mere sight, losing their will to fight.

## Elegant Affairs

The Nangong Family is known for their sophistication, excelling in both literature and martial arts, appreciating elegance and romance. Despite their reputation and self-respect, they enjoy listening to music, touching delicate hands, and engaging in romantic encounters, leading to numerous elegant affairs.

### Nangong Yuan

[[Nangong Yuan]] once rescued the number one beauty of the martial world, the courtesan [[Lady Wen|Su Yanxi]], from the clutches of Shangguan Jun, winning her affections. However, Nangong Yuan rejected Lady Wen's feelings and passed her on to his severely injured friend, Wen Wuwei.
<br><br>
After Wen Wuwei's death, Nangong Yuan felt guilty and visited Lady Wen at the Jinxiang Palace with a gift, not seeking reconciliation but seeking to make amends. Lady Wen used drugs and music to confuse him, leading to a night of passion with an ugly woman, resulting in the birth of [[Nangong Qian]]. Years later, when the woman brought Qian to the family, Nangong Yuan refused to acknowledge him.
<br><br>
Nangong Yuan regretted insincerity every day, but Lady Wen's grudge persisted, leading to a twenty-year feud between the Nangong Family and the Jinxiang Palace.

### Nangong Shen

[[Nangong Shen]] had been engaged to [[Shangguan Ying]] since childhood. Shangguan Ying, naturally beautiful, captured his heart at first sight, and they got along well. However, as they grew older, her beauty and management skills outshone him, leaving him feeling inadequate as just an eldest son. Shangguan Ying's fiery temper and lack of compatibility caused a growing rift between them.
<br><br>
To make Shangguan Ying wary, Nangong Shen toned down his arrogance and befriended a courtesan. However, when a refined woman like [[Le Ping]] came into his life, how could he resist her charms? A careless mistake led to her pregnancy. After the Battle of Jiangling, he had to annul the marriage and drive away Shangguan Ying, fearing her fiery temper might lead to violence upon discovering the truth.
<br><br>
Both generations had encounters with courtesans that caused women to shed tears, a trait that seemed to be hereditary.

## Notes

- The Nangong family's servants receive high wages, equivalent to modern standards higher than the monthly salary of a bird bear. [^1]
