In the martial world, people love to recite rhymes.

<br>

The martial arts world has always had the saying of "one gang, three families, and six major sects," which has been passed down for hundreds of years. With the changing times, the world changes, and the martial arts sects rise and fall, with the names of the six major sects constantly changing hands.

Only the Beggar's Sect always remains, even if the imperial court sends troops to besiege, they cannot be eliminated.
