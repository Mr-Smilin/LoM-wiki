Legend has it that there is an immortal in the Xinghua Forest in Nanyang. Those who do good deeds and have fate can find the magical pouches given by the immortal on the treetops, which are effective in bringing good luck and avoiding disasters.
<br><br>
The Xinghua Forest has mysterious formations. Even martial arts masters cannot find their way out without the guidance of the owner.
<br><br>
The most feared person in the life of the Qian Deng Tower Master is this immortal. He is referred to as "highly intelligent, close to demonic, suspected to be non-human."
