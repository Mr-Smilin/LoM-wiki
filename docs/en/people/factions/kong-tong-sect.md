# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

The Kongtong Sect is located on the Kongtong Mountain in the Qin Prefecture, at the border of the Song, Jin, Western Xia, and Tubo countries. With the changing territorial boundaries of various dynasties, it has changed allegiance several times and has also absorbed many talented individuals from foreign lands to settle in the mountains, with a particularly weak sense of loyalty to the ruler and patriotism.
<br><br>
At one point, there were over ten sects and gangs on Kongtong Mountain, occupying a corner of the mountain, each governing independently. After experiencing several dynastic changes and mergers, they were finally brought under the leadership of the Feitian, Duopo, Tiequan, and Xuangong sects. Each of the four sects has a sect leader, and in order to compete with the major sects in the Central Plains, they united and became known as the Kongtong Sect, with one person elected by the four sects to serve as the sect leader.
<br><br>
Now that the previous sect leader has left, the Kongtong Sect is without a leader, with each of the four sects vying for power, making it a turbulent time.

## The Four Gates of Kongtong

The four gates of Kongtong each harbor their own secrets. The four gates are constantly monitoring and restraining each other, and things can get quite extreme. The Feitian Gate and Duopo Gate are the two most confrontational gates among them.
<br><br>
The Feitian Gate excels in light-footed swordsmanship, the Duopo Gate specializes in exotic weapons, the Tiequan Gate excels in external skills, and the Xuangong Gate focuses on internal skills.

The Feitian Gate is the first gate of Kongtong and historically, most of the sect leaders of Kongtong have come from here. It is fair to say that the Feitian Gate represents Kongtong, and whenever there are martial arts events, it is usually the Feitian Gate that coordinates. They also hold the legal authority and consult with the leaders of the other three sects.
<br><br>
The sect leader, [[Fire Dragon Immortal]], is renowned for his immortal techniques. It is rumored that he was born with a third eye on his forehead, with three heads and six arms, and can even breathe out the Samadhi True Fire. His senior disciple, "General of Daoism" [[Danxiazi]], and expert [[Golden Crow Monk]] are strong candidates from the sect to succeed him, while the direct disciple [[Yu Xiaomei]] is the most prestigious among the contemporary Kongtong Four Beauties.
<br><br>
Every disciple of the Feitian Gate is proficient in the Feitian Footwork, which is a simplified version of the profound martial art "Immortal Crane Phantom Fist." The Feitian Footwork book also contains the basics of the "Crane Stance." Another book, the "Fire Cloud Sword Manual," was briefly mentioned by [[Xiahou Lan]]. The sect's unique skill is the "Heartburning Fire Seal."
<br><br>
According to [[Xiahou Lan]], in terms of a mediocre block, the Feitian Heart Method focuses on guarding the body with intention, with the front foot empty and the back foot solid, exhaling seven parts and inhaling three parts, maintaining agility in body posture. In simple terms, it is like a coward who is always ready to flee.
<br><br>
If [[Zhao Huo]] chooses this gate for his studies at the Kongtong Sect, he will reside in the Lingguang Wing Room in the south wing of the guesthouse, where he can enhance his light-footed skills. He may not learn much immortal techniques on the mountain, but he will certainly boast a lot.

The Duopo Gate is responsible for covert operations, night patrols, and apprehending criminals. Because they operate during the day and night, their complexion often looks haggard. Their martial arts techniques are quite different from those of the major sects in the Central Plains, leading to frequent misunderstandings and criticisms.
<br><br>
The sect leader of Duopo Gate is unknown, as he claims to be nameless. The martial arts of Duopo Gate focus on surprise attacks and assassinations, and it is not uncommon for the sect leader to conceal his identity. However, the Duopo Phantom [[Xiahou Lan|Lady Xiahou]], known as the number one beauty in the martial world, is a ruthless and infamous figure.
<br><br>
The unique weapon of the Golden Crow Monk from the Feitian Gate, the Fierce Sun Hammer, is said to be the nemesis of the martial arts of the Duopo Gate. The sect leader took the elite members into seclusion in the mountain caves to contemplate countermeasures, a process that had been ongoing for half a year by the time [[Zhao Huo]] began his studies at the Kongtong Sect. During this period, the Old Soul of Soul-Stealing acted as the interim sect leader.
<br><br>
The technique known as the Shadowless Claw is a unique martial art known to all disciples of the Duopo Gate. Nowadays, they have iron claws attached to their wrists to perform this technique, but in the past, they used their fingers. The secret of the "Frost Blade Breaking Bamboo Finger" has also been incorporated into this martial art.
<br><br>
According to [[Xiahou Lan]], in terms of a mediocre block, the Duopo Gate often fills up with true qi, moves stealthily, exhales while moving, and uses qi to strike, creating a threatening momentum. In simple terms, it is a coward who bluffs.
<br><br>
If [[Zhao Huo]] chooses this gate for his studies at the Kongtong Sect, he will reside in the Mengzhang Wing Room in the east wing of the guesthouse, where he can enhance his skills with hidden weapons. If fate allows, he may encounter [[Xiahou Lan|Lady Xiahou]], the number one beauty in the martial world, and even become her disciple.

The responsibilities of the Tiequan Gate are diverse, including iron forging, agriculture, brewing, pickling, hunting, slaughtering, crafting household items, and other livelihoods that are not suitable to be mentioned in front of women. Those unwanted by the other three gates are often sent here, resulting in a particularly large number of miscellaneous people. The weapons crafted here are renowned in the martial world, and it is said that the Huoyan Mountain Sword Pavilion was originally split from the Tiequan Gate a hundred years ago.
<br><br>
The sect leader of the Tiequan Gate, [[Lei Qian]], is not well-known in the martial world but is a skilled blacksmith known as Big Brother Lei. His direct disciple, "Bone-Crushing Demon" [[Yu Zhu]], is petite but incredibly strong, able to bend coins with a single hand, and once crushed the fist of a fellow disciple [[Meng Chen|Expert]] in her childhood.
<br><br>
The people of the Tiequan Gate are a mixed bag, including those who engage in petty theft. The secret manual "Iron Arm Divine Fist" has spread to the martial world, but strangely, the members of the Tiequan Gate do not use it, and it has even become the signature technique of the leader of the Feishiban, [[Shi Gongyuan]].
<br><br>
If [[Zhao Huo]] chooses this gate for his studies at the Kongtong Sect, he will reside in the Jianbing Wing Room in the west wing of the guesthouse, where he can enhance his physical strength. For the most part, his life will revolve around blacksmithing.

The Xuangong Gate is responsible for books, records, finances, household registers, and livestock. During the day, it is open for Kongtong disciples to borrow books, but the books available for browsing are generally uninteresting and outdated.
<br><br>
The territory of the Xuangong Gate is the Xuangong Cave. One cave leads to another, forming a network of interconnected caves, which is quite unique. The deeper the cave, the more valuable the books stored within, and only senior members with deep experience and high reputation in the sect are allowed entry. The last cave can only be opened by the sect leader in person or when all four sect leaders gather, making it a forbidden place.
<br><br>
The sect leader, [[Wei Ju]], was a talented woman from Lin'an before she ventured into the martial world. Known as "Wei Zhaodi" among scholars, she was as famous as Li Qingzhao in her time. She was friends with [[Shangguan Ying]] and had the opportunity to meet each other during their studies at the Kongtong Sect.
<br><br>
The Xuangong Gate excels in internal skills, and all disciples practice the "Iron Pipa Skill." Practitioners must stand on one leg using the Crane Stance from the Feitian Gate, support the iron pipa with their leg, pluck the strings with the finger strength of the Duopo Gate's "Frost Blade Breaking Bamboo Finger," and have a strong physique forged by the Tiequan Gate to uncover its secrets. Even then, no sound can be produced, only accumulating day by day, waiting for the gradual mastery of Xuangong skills. Disciples must play a piece on the iron pipa to pass the test, often taking seven to eight years or more.
<br><br>
If [[Zhao Huo]] chooses this gate for his studies at the Kongtong Sect, he will reside in the Zhiming Wing Room in the north wing of the guesthouse, where he can enhance his fist techniques.

## Landmarks and Attractions

### Colorless Market

The Colorless Market, also known as the Four Symbols Square, is an absolutely neutral zone where none of the four gates interfere. Nevertheless, it is mostly populated by members of the Tiequan Gate.
<br><br>
People can come here to meet their daily needs. If short on money, they can also find odd jobs. For those looking to make quick money, there are gambling houses and arenas, suitable for those who want to indulge in bad habits.
<br><br>
Sometimes, even the Fourth Senior Brother, [[Tang Weiyuan]], comes here for business, so it's worth a visit if you're lucky.

### Death Arena

> "As a weakling like you, you are not qualified to participate in the Death Arena Tournament held by our Kongtong Sect!!"

Located in the Four Symbols Square, it is said that the Death Arena Tournament has a long history, predating the Kongtong Sect.
<br><br>
Legend has it that during the Three Kingdoms period, the Qiang, Wusun, Yuezhi, and the famous Ma Family Army of the Western Liang frequently engaged in battles in Liangzhou, refusing to yield to each other. Later, when the Ma Family Army wanted to join Yuan Shang to fight Cao Cao, they were too busy to deal with the harassment from external tribes, so they came up with the Death Arena Tournament: the winner becomes the king, and the loser must leave.
<br><br>
Before Kongtong Mountain was unified, there were many small sects, and whenever there was a dispute, they would settle it in the arena. Today, the tradition of the Death Arena continues. Participants must sign a life and death agreement, and for each victory, a portion of the total betting amount is distributed.
<br><br>

### Half Rain Screen

The gathering place of the Kongtong Sect. Whenever there are important matters to discuss among the four gates or for ceremonies and festivals, they come here. The inauguration ceremony for the sect leader is also held here.
<br><br>
This place is ingeniously constructed by carving a recess into the mountain wall and excavating tunnels as passageways. At the top of the Half Rain Screen Cave, the immortal sword used by the former sect leader is inserted, and it is rumored that only a strong individual who has achieved enlightenment and reached the Great Vehicle stage can pull it out.

### Soul-Stealing Forest

The fields of Kongtong Mountain are cultivated by the disciples of the Tiequan Gate, who are self-sufficient.
<br><br>
Next to the fields is the Soul-Stealing Forest, which locals avoid, especially at night, as it is rumored to be inhabited by malevolent beings. Those who are mistaken for vegetable thieves by the night patrols of the Duopo Gate are often beaten before being haunted by ghosts.
<br><br>
The number one beauty in the martial world, [[Xiahou Lan|Duopo Phantom]], resides here and is not to be approached by strangers.

## Sect Leader

### Emergence of the Immortal

With numerous small sects in the mountains, the term "Kongtong Sect" is just a general term referring to all the sects on Kongtong Mountain. Later, the Feitian, Duopo, Tiequan, and Xuangong sects absorbed other sects and became the four overlords. They agreed to a decisive battle, and the victor would become the supreme ruler of Kongtong.
<br><br>
At this time, the first sect leader of Kongtong emerged out of nowhere. Legend has it that he arrived from the east riding a crane, wielding an immortal sword that commanded thunder, causing a large hole to appear in the mountain wall, creating the unique sight of the Half Rain Screen. The four sect leaders saw the divine power of this immortal and all knelt down in submission, appointing him as the sect leader. From then on, Kongtong enjoyed peace and harmony, free from internal strife.
<br><br>
Before the sect leader passed away, he thrust the immortal sword into the top of the Half Rain Screen Cave and departed on a crane to the west. He left behind an immortal decree, prophesying that a chosen one would appear in each generation of Kongtong, sent by the heavens to fulfill a divine mission, as if a clay figure sculpted by celestial beings had descended to the mortal realm.
<br><br>
During the sect leader's tenure, Kongtong was blessed, and no one could rival its might...

### The Four Beauties of Kongtong

In the spring of the year following [[
