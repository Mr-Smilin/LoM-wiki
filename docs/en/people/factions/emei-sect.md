The Emei Sect is one of the six major sects in the Central Plains and is probably the oldest sect in the martial arts world. It can be traced back to the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, founded by the ancestor of the White Ape, Master Situ Xuan Kong.
<br><br>
The Golden Summit of Mount Emei is a sacred place for Buddhism, and most of the disciples in the sect believe in Buddhism, while the rest believe in Taoism. The martial arts techniques are all derived from nature, such as the fist, sword, and staff techniques created by the White Ape ancestor imitating the spiritual monkeys in the mountains. The fist is the Emei [[White Ape Reaching Arm Fist|Reaching Arm Fist]], the sword is the Ape Lord Sword, and the staff is the Ape King Staff.
<br><br>
Later generations followed the ancestors and imitated other creatures, creating various fist techniques such as snake, crane, and tiger styles. Emphasizing learning through observation and imitation, from intention to form, it is called Form-Intention, which is completely opposite to the philosophy of the [[Tang Sect]]'s Forget-Intention.
<br><br>
Although they are neighbors with the [[Tang Sect]], they are not very close and have little interaction. This is mainly because they are different from the Tang Sect in their arrogance and untamed nature. They are aloof and reclusive, minding their own business. The sect leader, Xiang Wuworry, rarely travels the martial arts world and has few notable achievements. On the other hand, his junior brother "Wind God" Jie Wuchen is more famous, being a young talent in the martial arts world and considering [[Tang Buyi]] as his rival.

## Heart Sword

Today, everyone in the Emei Sect practices martial arts, with strong bodies and agile skills. However, in the past, the Emei Sect was known for its swordsmanship and was extremely powerful.
<br><br>
It is said that hundreds of years ago, even before the founding ancestor of the [[Tang Sect]], there were no other sects in Shu, only the dominant Emei Sect, which was renowned for its swordsmanship. The Ape Lord Sword technique passed down from the White Ape ancestor evolved through several generations to reach its peak.
<br><br>
However, things always change, and one day they suddenly felt that the heights were too cold to bear. They abandoned the use of swords, kept the sword in their hearts, and called it the "Heart Sword," using it to temper their body and mind.

## Wind Monkey in the Wind

The Emei Sect pays great attention to seniority. When disciples apprentice themselves to a master, they change their names according to their seniority. For example, the sect leader Xiang Wuworry and the Wind God Jie Wuchen are both of the "Wu" generation. The previous generation's seniors were of the "Cheng" generation, and almost all of them have now retired from the martial arts world, mainly due to a notorious traitor.
<br><br>
The name of the Emei traitor is Yuan Chengfeng, known in the martial arts world as "Wind Monkey in the Wind." He was extremely skilled in the Ape King Staff technique and was once a formidable figure in the martial arts world. [[Tang Zhongling]] once commented on him: "Very difficult to defeat."
<br><br>
In his early years, he was a righteous and chivalrous hero, but when the old demonic sect rose, he was eager to make a name for himself. He challenged the leader of the Emei Sect and was defeated by the Righteous Joyful Righteousness, kneeling down to beg for mercy and swallowing the heart-seeking pill, becoming a lackey of the Righteous Joyful Sect.
<br><br>
He stole poison from the [[Tang Sect]], poisoned the mountain, and intended to wipe out the Emei Sect as a way to gain fame. As a result, the seniors of the Emei Sect either died or were severely disabled in their martial arts. Yuan Chengfeng was rewarded for this deed and was appointed as one of the Seven Immortals of the Righteous Joyful Sect, ruling over Emei and indulging in debauchery.
<br><br>
It wasn't until later, when [[Tang Zhongling]] used the Flying Swallow Star Feather to cut off his weapon and fingers, kicking him off the Golden Summit of Emei, that his whereabouts became unknown. People thought he had fallen to his death in pieces, until the Wind and Rain Mountain Martial Arts Convention revealed that he had survived.
