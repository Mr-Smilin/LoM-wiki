Twenty years ago, the old demonic sect that caused chaos in the martial arts world originated from Tibetan Esoteric Buddhism. However, later generations distorted and fabricated it for personal desires, completely changing its original nature.

<br>

According to [[Nan Gongheng]], the sect members were all violent and reckless individuals who acted solely on impulse, disregarding consequences, with not a single sane person among them. They not only committed numerous evils but also recruited soldiers and planned to enslave the Central Plains.

<br>

In the end, under the leadership of the newly appointed martial arts alliance leader [[Long Yuan]], leaders of various sects united to besiege and ultimately destroy the Blissful Sect.
<br clear="all">

## Key Figures

The sect leader is the King of Western Xia, [[Li Renyou]], known as the "Blissful Demon Lord," and also the master of the legendary assassin organization, [[Thousand Lantern Tower]].

<br>

The left and right protectors, with the left adept in powerful internal energy cultivation of the "Swallowing Heaven Treasure Mirror," and the right skilled in fierce knife techniques using the strange poison "Corpse Heart Worm," manipulated righteous martial artists for their own use. The sect leader's power surpassed both, with the Nine Revolutions Reincarnation, Swallowing Heaven Treasure Mirror, decades of demonic cultivation, unmatched in ancient and modern times. Wielding the Ghost Lotus King Blade, causing ghosts to cry and gods to howl, even [[Wanli Pengcheng]] couldn't help but shudder upon seeing it.

<br>

The Blissful Seven Immortals include the known Emei "Strange Ape in the Wind," [[Yuan Chengfeng]], who stole poison from the Tang Clan and poisoned the senior Emei members, either causing their deaths or rendering them powerless due to damaged meridians. For this achievement, he was appointed as one of the Blissful Seven Immortals, ruling over Emei, indulging in debauchery. The other six members remain undisclosed.

## Corpse Heart Worm

Used by the right protector, this strange poison originates from India.

<br>

When this poison encounters blood, it transforms into wax, breaks out of its cocoon, infiltrates the body, disguises itself as human flesh and blood, making it difficult even for skilled doctors to expel. If not taken regularly to suppress it, it will devour the victim's heart flesh and blood, releasing highly toxic mucus, causing the victim's blood to boil, appearing as if possessed, suffering torment until death. If the worms penetrate the brain without the practitioner's permission, even thoughts of self-termination are futile, truly evil and ruthless.

<br>

During the Blissful Sect's reign of terror in the martial arts world, numerous heroes were humiliated and degraded by this poison, turning them into unrecognizable beings. Due to this curse, [[Yuan Chengfeng]] ruined the senior Emei members, [[Tang Lu]] was controlled by others, and the assassins of the Thousand Lantern Tower couldn't escape betrayal, resulting in endless tragedies.

<br>

However, if encountered by a practitioner with pure Tang Clan skills, unless their life is in imminent danger and they are taken advantage of, the Corpse Heart Worm will poison them upon entry into the body.

<br>

[[Tang Zheng]] saw its unique ability to assimilate into human flesh and blood, developing the exclusive "Ten Thousand Longevity Corpse Heart Pill," which, when ingested, dissolves into the blood, spreading throughout the body, repairing internal injuries. Unfortunately, the pill's manufacturing process is extremely intricate, and the materials are rare. The Corpse Heart Worm must be fed with human blood and poisonous herbs, increasing the dosage daily to prevent its death from toxins, and then refining it into a pill takes several years. Even though it is effective, the pill is inherently toxic and difficult for non-Tang Clan members to tolerate.

## Nine Revolutions Reincarnation Technique

One of the three treasures of the Blissful Sect, it is said that with each deeper level of mastery, one faces a life-threatening crisis, requiring the consumption of the Nine Springs Pill to revive from death, undergoing a rebirth. [[Long Yuan]] has taken it and indeed it is a miraculous pill, even stealing the formula.

<br>

[[Tang Buyi]] once experienced stagnation in his cultivation progress and practiced this technique stolen from the left protector of the Blissful Sect, but it conflicted with the internal skills of the Tang Clan, leading to demonic possession and a bottleneck. When triggered during the return of the Flying Hero, this technique was brought under control, residing in the lower dantian, flowing through the meridians silently, until the cycle was complete, using true energy to massage the heart, releasing the false death state and undergoing reincarnation.

<br>

[[Shen Tulong]] claimed that in his previous life, the aging body of [[Li Renyou]] had decayed, and his soul left his body, seizing another body and being reborn.

## Swallowing Heaven Treasure Mirror

The evil skill used by the left protector, the horrifying gluttonous scripture, the ~~Star Absorption Great Technique~~. When used, it locks onto the opponent's pulse, instantly enveloping them in a collapsing pressure, depriving them of control over their internal energy, continuously draining their internal energy and absorbing it for oneself.

<br>

The [[Kongtong Sect]]'s [[Iron Pipa Technique]] is the nemesis of the Swallowing Heaven Treasure Mirror, causing [[Shen Tulong]] to contemplate destroying the Kongtong Sect. If absorbed by this technique, with a pluck of the strings, a hundred pulses resonate, the absorbed different types of true energy not yet assimilated will go out of control, raging within the body, causing internal injuries.

## Destruction

Please refer to the article on [[The Decisive Battle with the Blissful Sect]].

## Resurgence

Using the Nine Revolutions Reincarnation Technique, [[Li Renyou]] reincarnated as [[Shen Tulong]] and joined the [[Qingcheng Sect]]. Secretly instructing the Thousand Lantern Tower to infiltrate the Kongtong Sect and destroy the nemesis, the [[Iron Pipa Technique]].

<br>

In addition, sect members had been secretly operating in Song for many years, preparing for invasion. When the martial arts alliance attacked the Tang Clan, the Blissful Sect took the opportunity to rise, controlling various official roads and stations, collaborating with the Western Xia troops passing through the Jin Dynasty to occupy Western Shu. If [[Golden Crow Monk]] is elected as the head of the Kongtong Sect, he will guide them through the pass.

<br>

By the time the officials in Lin'an received the news, it was already several months later, and Shu had long since fallen.

## Notes

- The Blissful Sect's three treasures, only the Nine Revolutions Reincarnation Technique is mentioned, the other two are unclear, speculated to be the Corpse Heart Worm and the Swallowing Heaven Treasure Mirror.
- During the Flying Hero's landing incident, the fire poison of the Western Scorpion King was used.
