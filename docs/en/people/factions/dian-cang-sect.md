> "The sword of Point Cang is the fastest in the world, surpassing words, swift as lightning."

The Point Cang Faction is a sword-based faction, with the top expert never being the head. They believe that swordsmanship is the way of heaven, seeking enlightenment through the sword. Once one becomes the head, they are burdened by worldly matters, losing the path to the great way.
<br><br>
They study Confucianism, viewing the sword as the tool of a gentleman, requiring solemnity and dignity, neither overbearing nor servile, with a guarded heart. Their pride often leads them to never yield even in death.
<br><br>
Although located in Dali, they consider themselves part of the six major factions of the Central Plains. They have considered moving to the Central Plains, but have been repeatedly blocked by the [[Tang Sect]], engaging in numerous conflicts.

## Nicknames

Every Point Cang disciple who ventures out into the world is bestowed a nickname by their mentor upon returning home. For example, "White Rainbow Swordsman" Xu Guanghui, "Morning Sun Swordsman" Sheng Hongnian, and "Cang Song Swordsman" [[Ye Yunzhou]]. The current head, [[Point Cang Twin Masters|Guan Yunkè]], was known as "Guan Yun Swordsman" in his youth, while [[Point Cang Twin Masters|Ting Haisheng]] was called "Ting Hai Swordsman".
<br><br>
Among them, [[Ye Yunzhou]] is considered the outstanding figure of the contemporary Point Cang, shocking the martial arts world with his swift swordsmanship. He is modest and well-regarded in the martial world, known as the fastest swordsman of Point Cang.
<br><br>
The current head, [[Point Cang Twin Masters|Guan Yunkè]], and his junior brother [[Point Cang Twin Masters|Ting Haisheng]] practice the art of dual swordsmanship, known in the martial world as the Point Cang Twin Masters. While they have not reached the peak individually, their combined strength increases exponentially. It is said that even if the leaders of the [[Blissful Sect]] and the hero [[Long Yuan]] join forces, they may not be a match for them.

## Taking the Sword as Wife

Every new disciple must undergo the sword-seeking and sword-cleansing ceremony. From then on, they treat the sword as their wife and friend, seeking the highest realm of unity between man and sword. They meticulously care for their beloved swords daily, often using only one sword throughout their lives.
<br><br>
While it is said "where the sword is, there is life; where the sword is destroyed, there is death," in reality, swords can be repaired or replaced. Many specifically seek swords from the Sword Pavilion on Mount Huoyan.
<br><br>
If one treats the sword as a wife, it is akin to remarrying. If one has many swords, does that equate to having multiple wives?

## Killing Kin to Achieve Enlightenment

Point Cang swordsmen pursue swordsmanship to the point of obsession, believing that worldly attachments hinder their speed in swordplay. To comprehend the divine secrets, they are willing to sever emotional ties and even abandon their families.
<br><br>
Some extremists even advocate the shocking doctrine of "killing kin to achieve enlightenment," where they defame their loved ones and only find peace after killing them, envisioning themselves as free from worries and advancing in martial prowess.
<br><br>
[[Point Cang Twin Masters]] spared no effort to correct and stop this, punishing their misled disciples such as White Rainbow Swordsman and Morning Sun Swordsman, along with [[Ye Yunzhou|Cang Song Swordsman]], by cutting off their wrists, expelling them from the faction, and handing them over to the authorities, finally eradicating this heretical belief.

## Point Cang Sword Saint

The Point Cang Faction once produced a remarkable genius who astounded the world, known as the Sword Saint.
<br><br>
Legend has it that the former Point Cang Sword Saint was aloof and proud, challenging the heroes of his time when he arrived in the Central Plains, defeating them all before retiring to the Point Cang Mountain Sword Abode in Dali. Within the Sword Saint's former residence lie three sword intents, which only those with exceptional talent and innate swordsmanship can comprehend.
<br><br>
To preserve the sanctity of the Sword Saint's residence, it is strictly guarded at all times. Only Point Cang disciples who have made significant contributions are allowed to enter the Sword Abode for three days to comprehend martial arts. Those who can grasp the three sword intents left by the Sword Saint will be named the contemporary Sword Saint, a position even more revered than the head of Point Cang, with even the Emperor of Dali showing respect.
<br><br>
[[Ye Yunshang]] displayed exceptional talent, creating the fourth move of the Sword Saint [[Yunshang Sword Art|“Roaming the Hometown with Fragrant Sleeves, Spring Weeps at Dawn, Don’t Hold Back”]] after sneaking in for a brief moment in his childhood.

## Grudge with the Tang Sect

Once upon a time, a pair of martial arts lovers had a dispute that involved the senior members of the Tang Sect. When the Point Cang Sword Saint passed by and intervened, he was forced to reveal his true skills to gain authority, making everyone listen to him.
<br><br>
The senior members of the Tang Sect were furious and declared, "No matter how high your martial arts skills are, nothing can override reason! Others may flatter you, but the Tang Sect will not! We may not be able to defeat you, but we refuse to listen to you!" With that, they took their own lives by poison.
<br><br>
Upon hearing of this incident, the head of the Tang Sect was also enraged and resorted to poisoning and crippling the Sword Saint's martial arts. As a result, the two factions harbored deep enmity.
<br><br>
After the [[Battle with the Blissful Sect]], when the Tang Sect was severely weakened, the Point Cang Faction took advantage of the situation to provoke and challenge the [[Tang Zhongling|Tang Sect Head]]. In the end, the Tang Sect lost, but the Tang Sect Head defeated [[Nameless|Point Cang Sword Saint]]. With the intervention of the Southern Palace Master, the Head spared the Sword Saint's life, only forcing him to sheathe his sword and retire in exchange for the Point Cang Faction's retreat.
