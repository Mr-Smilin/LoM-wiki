The Nijiao Hungry Ghost Path, rampant in the East Sea, often clashes with the [[Shangguan Family|Shangguan]] and the court. The Law King Liu E is currently the number one wanted criminal in maritime law enforcement documents. The court has sent troops multiple times to sea to suppress the bandits, but all efforts have been in vain. The whereabouts of these pirates are still unknown to this day.

The gang members have a fondness for fish paste, and if you have eaten their fish paste, you are considered a happy companion who has shared fish paste with them. Even their signature weapon is a fish-cutting knife, with a unique and extremely sharp design.

Those targeted by the gang will experience extreme humiliation before being released, but those who provoke them will be pushed into the sea to feed the sharks.

## Atrocities

The gang leader Liu E is extremely crazy and lawless. However, he is not simply greedy and evil, but rather shows no harm to the common people. While the White Shark Gang is denounced by the court as traitors, they are more beloved by the local populace than the local officials. The following are known events, whether they are considered evil is up to the reader to decide:

- Robbing merchant ships and official ships, and if officials are captured, they are publicly stripped and paraded through the streets.

- Smuggling private salt, and maliciously disrupting the official salt market by half-selling and half-giving away.

- Throwing live fish into windows of homes, openly disrupting the fishing industry order, and challenging the Cang Gang.

- Even on the day when the court envoy was invited to the [[Shangguan Family|Shangguan Family]] for a feast, fish were thrown. When [[Jie Wuchen]] saw this and found the fish smelly, he intended to show his power in front of [[Shangguan Ying]] and stopped Liu E, demanding his execution. Liu E casually grabbed a passerby's sword, using deceptive sword techniques that were neither offensive nor defensive, all aimed at deceiving opponents. [[Jie Wuchen]] was unable to use any of his skills, became so angry that he spat blood and was forced to change the name of his "Wind Thunder Leg" technique to "[[Using Great Force to Kick]]", crying as he ran away.

- During the South Gong Shou banquet, they attacked Cang Gang ships. <MarkdownWrapper>||Originally planning to kidnap Shangguan Ying, but failed. Upon hearing that Cang Gang had withheld rice supplies meant for Anji Lane, Liu E cut off their nipples. Subsequently, they "attacked" Anji Lane, throwing all the rice supplies in, ensuring that poor families could eat until they were full.||</MarkdownWrapper>

- Attacked the [[Songshan Sect|South Songshan Temple]], beating the abbot with a rolling pin, forcing the abbot to run naked in the streets, while their accomplices cut fish and fed the abbot's body to the dogs, causing the abbot to suffer mental trauma and retire that day. <MarkdownWrapper>||Shi Ming happened to be traveling at the time and narrowly escaped.||</MarkdownWrapper>

- Kidnapped [[Shangguan Ying]]. Liu E claimed to invite her as a guest in a friendly manner, but after being scolded, threatened to sell her to a foreign country.

- Went to Fengyu Mountain with the Hell Path to rescue the Human Path, setting fire to the mountain.

- During Fourth Senior Brother's business trip, <MarkdownWrapper>||if he changed his route to visit his younger sister, he would encounter the Hungry Ghost Path on the way to Fengyu Mountain and be completely looted. His companions would be stripped of their clothing, have their nipples sucked by live fish, and suffer extreme humiliation. Due to Zhao Huo's mercy, only Fourth Senior Brother was spared, but he was resented by his companions afterwards.||</MarkdownWrapper>

- After the Western Wulin Battle, fearing retaliation from the [[Tang Sect]], Master Shi Ming did not dare to stay for a moment, packed his bags, and fled overseas by boat, only to be captured by the White Shark Gang. After experiencing extreme humiliation, he met his end in the belly of a fish.

## Notes

- White Shark language is Japanese, Nihongo! Kabang nih su!
