After the [Jingkang Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingkang_Incident) (1125-1127), the Great Song dynasty moved its capital to Lin'an, with the current Emperor being Song Ningzong (1168â€”1224).

<br>

Bordering the Jin dynasty and Western Xia, the territory of Great Song was repeatedly invaded by the Jin dynasty. Zhao Fang and Danxiazi defended the Xiangyang front, while twenty years ago, Western Xia conspired with the Blissful Sect to attack the Hexi Corridor.

<br>

Having strained relations with the martial arts world, after the Tang Clan raided the execution ground, orders were secretly given to weaken the Tang Clan through the Shangguan Family, with the intention of destroying them.

## Leader of the Martial Arts World

According to what Nangong Heng said at his birthday banquet, there were three martial arts mobilizations in his hundred years of life.

<br>

In the first alliance, the leader was Nangong Zhi, who led the people to Bianliang to resist the Jin army for two full years. Emperor Qinzong and Emperor Huizong were captured, Bianliang fell, and seeing the situation was lost, he apologized to his martial arts colleagues and disbanded the alliance. After Emperor Gaozong declared himself emperor in Yingtian Prefecture, he intended to recruit martial artists, and ordered the leader to organize his troops and join the army under the command of Liu Guangshi, the military commissioner of Fengguo. If he resisted the imperial decree, he would lead troops to attack and plunder, causing discord between the martial arts world and the court.

<br>

In the second alliance, Yue Wangye emerged and called for a northern expedition. He drank turbid wine with the martial arts strategist Zeng Wen in the river, asking him to come out of seclusion and recover the lost territory. With Zeng Wen and Hongpang Wang as leaders, one controlled the cultural alliance in the western thirteen provinces, and the other controlled the martial alliance in the eastern thirteen provinces, dividing the literary and martial sides of the sky, following Yue Wangye to recover lost land. Until the twelve golden orders, they killed a loyal and patriotic general. Zeng Wen disappeared halfway while advising Wangye; Hongpang Wang entered the Buddhist sect, with the Dharma name Chunmian. The people of the martial arts world once again swore never to trust the court again.

<br>

In the third alliance, the [Battle of the Blissful Sect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Blissful_Sect) twenty years ago. The Blissful Sect rebelled in the Central Plains, intending to collaborate with Western Xia to attack the Hexi Corridor, open up the north-south route, and control the vital points of Great Song and the Jin dynasty. The leader Longyuan led the martial arts world to besiege the Blissful Sect. For more details, please refer to the relevant articles.
