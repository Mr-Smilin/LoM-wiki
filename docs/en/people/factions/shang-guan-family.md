The Shangguan Family is a large clan that migrated to Fuzhou and established roots in Jianzhou during the late Tang Dynasty.

<br>

The Shangguan Family became wealthy through maritime trade. The family head, also known as the "Chief Helmsman," was deeply loved by the people. There is a saying: "With Shangguan, no corrupt officials, returning from the sea brings joy to a hundred families."

<br>

Every year, a considerable amount of silver is spent to maintain relations with the court. The relationship with the Fujian branch of the [[Songshan Sect]] is also very close. Each year, they donate a large sum of wealth to the temple to gain reputation.

<br>

However, it is difficult to please the [[White Shark Gang]], who often deliberately cause trouble and disrupt maritime trade. No matter how many gifts are sent, they are returned covered in pig blood.

<br>

The Shangguan Family has developed the "[[Wave Pursuit Technique]]" for maritime combat, aiming to destroy the opponent's foothold first, leaving them in a dilemma. Subsequently, a surging giant wave will press forward until the enemy is forced into a corner.

<br>

The current family head, [[Shangguan Jun]], is calm and introverted, gradually withdrawing from the martial world. The family heirloom, the "Golden Back Dragon King Blade," has been sealed for nearly a decade without being used in combat.
<br clear="all">

## Cang Gang

The [[Cang Gang]] is secretly supported by the Shangguan Family, a fact known to everyone. Even the [[Wave Turning Sword Technique]] is derived from the swordsmanship passed down by the Shangguan Family.

<br>

Many gang members were recruited by [[Shangguan Ying]]. In the eyes of the gang members, she holds a higher status than the gang leader, willing to go through fire and water to follow her and make a living.

## Xueshan Sect

[[Shangguan Jun]] and the leader of the [[Xueshan Sect]] were close friends. Before Xiahou Lan was born, there was a marriage agreement between them.

<br>

However, when the Xueshan Sect was attacked by the [[Kongtong Sect]] and sought help from the Shangguan Family, the family head used the excuse of a distant journey to coldly watch and let the Xueshan Sect be annihilated.

## Nangong Engagement

[[Nangong Shen]] and [[Shangguan Ying]] had a childhood engagement. They were praised in the martial world for their talents and beauty, a perfect match. However, due to their conflicting personalities, they found it difficult to be together.

<br>

After the Jiangling incident, [[Nangong Shen]] impregnated the courtesan [[Le Ping]] out of fear that [[Shangguan Ying]] would be upset if the scandal was exposed. He used the excuse that she had been abducted by [[Liu Ya]] to break off the engagement.

## Plot Against the Tang Sect

After the court was alarmed by the incident at the Tang Sect's execution ground, they sought the involvement of the Shangguan Family in martial affairs. Even the head of the two major families, [[Shangguan Jun]], did not dare to confront the Tang Sect directly. He spent a lot of effort to weaken the Tang Sect indirectly, contributing to the mountain of debt the Tang Sect accumulated.

<br>

Seeing [[Tang Zhongling]] seriously ill, he colluded with [[Shi Ming]] and [[Tang Shouhong]] to incite internal strife within the Tang Sect. At the Fengyu Mountain Assembly, he allowed [[Shi Ming]] to slander freely. If not for the court's reluctance to provoke the martial world, they might have acted against the Tang Sect sooner.

<br>

The merchant group of [[Tang Weiyuan]] was also part of the conspiracy. All the business owners in the group were arranged by [[Shangguan Ying]] to keep him away from the martial world.

## Golden Back Dragon King Blade

The family heirloom of the Shangguan Family, along with the [[Tan Ba Blade]]'s Mountain Breaking Slash, the Guangzhou Exile's Dream-Cutting Blade, and the [[Li Renyou|Joyful Master]]'s Ghost Lotus King Blade, are known as the Four Famous Blades of the martial world.

<br>

It is said that when this blade is unsheathed, it is like a golden-backed dragon playing in the vast sea, engulfing boats in terrifying waves, making it extremely dangerous! Even Xiahou Lan's Iron Umbrella cannot withstand it. Despite being struck by the "Plum Quiver at the Tip of the Branch" from the Xueshan Sect, it still could not shake off the stickiness and was left in tatters, unable to be recovered.

<br>

On the day of his retirement, [[Shangguan Jun]] prayed to his ancestors and buried the blade in the Shangguan Family's main courtyard to suppress evil. It was later unearthed after the Fengyu Mountain Assembly for use in the attack on the Tang Sect.

## Substitutes

(v3206 Unpacking Information)

<MarkdownWrapper>
||The Shangguan Family's commercial associations and money exchanges are widespread in the Central Plains, especially in Jiangdong. To facilitate the circulation of goods and reduce the risk of carrying money, the Shangguan Commercial Association internally issued paper currency, similar to bills of exchange, known as "substitutes."~~In simple terms, it's like a multiplier card.~~||
</MarkdownWrapper>

<br>

<MarkdownWrapper>
||To avoid arousing suspicion from the court, this currency can only be used internally. Holding Shangguan substitutes allows for the exchange of goods at all Shangguan commercial establishments, but cash cannot be withdrawn. In a roundabout way, one can use substitutes to exchange for salt, tea, and incense, then trade them for money at other shops, although it often results in a loss.||
</MarkdownWrapper>

<br>

<MarkdownWrapper>
||The shopkeepers at various exchange stores are personally appointed by Shangguan Ying. When they receive money and issue substitutes, they must keep accounts and maintain their reputation.||

## Notes

- Introduction on Bird Bear's Facebook: [Link](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=294712563082126&set=pcb.294712606415455)
- There are many branches of the Shangguan Family, but only the main branch can bear the Shangguan surname, passing down the family business in a single line.
- Although holding an official position in the court, they are not very concerned about warfare. In times of crisis, they will sail to Japan to avoid trouble, maintaining contact with the Hojo family. After the engagement with the [[Nangong Family|Nangong]] was broken off, [[Shangguan Jun]] planned to marry [[Shangguan Ying]] to the Hojo family.
