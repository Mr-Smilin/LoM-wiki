</InfoList>

The Qingcheng Sect follows the Daoist Zhengyi Alliance, revering Zhang Tian Shi. They practice drawing symbols and chanting spells, and unlike the [[Quanzhen Sect|Quanzhen Dao]], Daoists in Qingcheng can marry and have children.
<br><br>
Their practice emphasizes harmony and balance, aiming to unify all things into one, and one into nothingness. Therefore, Qingcheng Daoists are generally pure-hearted and have excellent cultivation.
<br><br>
There used to be a somewhat impolite saying in the martial world: "The Qingcheng disciples one meets in the jianghu are just half-hearted, the truly powerful ones are in the mountains, never seeking fame or profit, only pursuing their own immortality."

## Wu Wei Elixir Dao

While the Qingcheng Sect uses swords, their specialty lies in qigong. The so-called Wu Wei Elixir Dao actually involves cultivating internal elixirs, not the kind you consume.
<br><br>
Mastery of Qingcheng qigong is difficult to achieve. When practiced to a deep level, the sound of thunder can be heard when drawing the sword, and ordinary weapons are as fragile as straw, easily broken in a single strike. Without even using a sword, simply imbuing a duster with true qi can turn it into a hammer that can smash like a sledgehammer, incredibly powerful.
<br><br>
[[Zou Bo|Master Zou]] is a qigong master, proficient in the authentic mysteries of the Dao, with no one else in the world capable of matching him. It is said that even if the combined inner strength of the Four Heroes of the Tang Sect were pitted against him, they would likely lose more than win. This demonstrates how formidable the internal skills of Qingcheng are, as only a fool would challenge a Qingcheng disciple in a contest of inner strength.

## Huan Xu Elixir

The Qingcheng Sect Leader, [[Zou Bo|Daoist Zou]], once had a philosophical discussion with the ancient True Man Haoda of the Quanzhen Seven Sons, which led to the introduction of the external elixir technique from the [[Quanzhen Sect|Quanzhen]]. The "Huan Xu Elixir" is the result of the joint research efforts of Master Zou and Daoist Haoda.
<br><br>
This elixir is extremely rare, taking several years to refine a single pill, requiring numerous precious materials and the support of skilled practitioners within the sect. It aims to harmonize with Daoist internal practices, assisting practitioners in refining their spirits, returning to the simplicity of the great Dao, and slowing down the consumption of life force.
<br><br>
After the old battle with the former demonic sect, the Tang Sect Leader, [[Tang Zhongling]], was plagued by injuries. Daoist Zou once presented him with one pill. Tang Zhongling gave it to [[Tang Zheng]] for research, leading to improvements in the Tang Sect's pepper powder poison, but unfortunately, it still could not cure the Leader's chronic illness.
<br><br>
[[Ye Yunzhou]] once visited the Qingcheng Sect seeking elixirs to treat the illness of [[Ye Yunshang]], but was ultimately turned away by [[Shentu Long]].
<br><br>
During the centennial celebration of [[Nangong Heng|Elder Nangong]], Qingcheng's Master Zou also presented a pill as a longevity gift. If the Tang Sect had chosen the Ten Thousand Longevity Rejuvenation Pill as a gift, it would have mentioned the aforementioned effects and the conflicting effects of the two elixirs.

## Zhao Kui's Betrayal

During the final battle of the peak between the old demonic sect and the righteous sects, each side sent out three peerless masters to determine life and death, and discuss heroes. Qingcheng's [[Zou Bo|Master Zou]]'s junior brother, [[Zhao Kui]], fought against the left envoy of the demonic sect, and after being defeated and severely injured, the envoy escaped without a trace.
<br><br>
Filled with regret, Zhao Kui was tormented, seemingly cursed by the demonic sect, becoming increasingly paranoid and violent. His martial arts grew stronger, and his appearance became more ferocious. Eventually, he defected from Qingcheng and joined the [[Mud Sect]], becoming the King of Hell Dao.
