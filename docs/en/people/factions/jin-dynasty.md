## Dragon Garden

An institution established by Jin Dynasty, serving under the Shandong Xuanfushi [[Pusian Anzhen]], responsible for recruiting and persuading martial artists from the Song Dynasty.

<br>

Currently, only the martial artist from the Dragon Garden, [[Chen Xu|Hua Cheng Si Shao]], appeared in the [[Longxiang]] temple incident, known for his extraordinary martial arts skills.

## Notes

- [[Emperor Xuanzong of Jin]] and [[Long Yuan]] were once sworn brothers, but they broke ties after the [[Battle of Jilejiao|Jilejiao incident]], with [[Longxiang]] being her niece.
- The [[Quanzhen Sect|Quanzhen]] and the [[Songshan Sect|Songshan]] are two factions, one in Shaanxi and the other in Henan, both within the territory of the Jin Dynasty. Despite being friendly with the Jin Dynasty, both factions still consider themselves part of the Central Plains' six major sects, which has drawn criticism.
