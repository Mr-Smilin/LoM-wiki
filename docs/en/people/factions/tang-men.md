> "Fight your mother!"

As the top hidden weapon master in the world, Tangmen is located in Sichuan Shuzhong, renowned for its unique hidden weapons and dual cultivation of poisons and medicines. From gold coins in the bag, arrows hidden in the sleeves, to needles in the hair bun, and red powder in the pot, every member of Tangmen is a deadly weapon.
<br><br>
Their practice of internal skills is unconventional, relying on medicinal diets rather than hard work. They use pepper powder to nourish their internal energy day and night, making their bodies full of poison.
<br><br>
Their demeanor is neither overbearing nor humble, walking the line between good and evil. They have been praised as the backbone of the martial arts world, but also carry the reputation of using poison and hidden weapons. Both the righteous and evil factions fear them, and even the court is dissatisfied with their stubbornness.
<br><br>
Despite their past glory, they have faced hardships and their numbers have dwindled. Their ancestral texts have been lost, with later generations compiling fragments into the "Tangmen Hidden Weapons Compendium," "Poison Classic," and "Tangmen Pharmacopoeia," with the latter lost upon the death of the leader's wife, Tang Lu.
<br><br>
The leader, Tang Zhongling, is a remarkable figure, known for his fierce temperament. In his youth, he was undefeated and made countless enemies. If it weren't for the emergence of the old demonic sect, the Tangmen would have become enemies of the martial arts world.
<br><br>
They have a deep-seated enmity with the Diancang faction, engaging in dozens of battles over the years.

## Origin

The original Tangmen was just a family named Tang living in seclusion in the mountains.
<br><br>
During the An Lushan Rebellion of the Tang Dynasty, a catastrophic event in Central Plains history, the founder could not bear the suffering of the people and spent all his wealth to buy farmland, provide porridge and water to disaster victims, and teach self-defense martial arts to prevent banditry.
<br><br>
They even occupied an outpost, openly defying the imperial decree and fighting against Emperor Xuanzong who sought refuge in Shu. The founder and his family were determined to defend the outpost to the death. While the physical body may perish and the family line extinguished, the spirit of Tangmen must be perpetuated.
<br><br>
Remembering the founder's teachings, the tenth family rule states:

> Good and evil reside in one's heart, not in the words of others.<br>
> Dare to uphold justice and challenge the world, willing to debate right and wrong based on reason,<br>
> But seek to have a broad mind, willing to be pointed at by thousands, be enemies with tens of thousands, I will still laugh it off.

## Inner Circle and Non-Family Disciples

Tangmen disciples are divided into inner circle and non-family disciples. Non-family disciples are prohibited from learning the core techniques, while inner circle disciples are forbidden to practice other martial arts.
<br><br>
Non-family disciples must serve and accumulate merits before being noticed by the master and accepted into the inner circle, where they learn the exclusive advanced martial arts. However, non-family disciples are not obligated to stay in the Tang family compound like the inner circle disciples.
<br><br>
Those who have benefited from Tangmen's help are expected to carry on the will of Tangmen, even if they are not from the Tang family, just as the founder did for the people, unafraid of criticism and willing to help the needy.
<br><br>
This is the true meaning of being a non-family disciple, while those who are accepted into the inner circle are actually orphaned with no family. The founder took pity on their background and adopted them as foster children. In reality, there is no distinction of status between non-family and inner circle disciples.

## Misdeeds

> "Our previous leaders have committed many misdeeds. I wonder which one the Third Senior Brother is referring to?"

People in the martial arts world tend to look down on hidden weapons and poisons, especially when it comes to Tangmen, who have a reputation for being uncompromising and independent. If they hear something they don't like, they may resort to violence, tarnishing their reputation. However, Tangmen has also produced some villains who have committed many misdeeds.
<br><br>
Each villain created by Tangmen requires future generations to spend a century clearing the family name. Tang Zhongling, in his youth, challenged anyone who spoke ill of Tangmen. Thanks to him, the martial arts world no longer calls Tangmen sinister, but ruthless.
<br><br>
While their reputation has been restored, they have enemies everywhere.

### Purple Gold Hand

"The Purple Gold Hand," a ruthless villain, predated even the old demonic sect. He infused his arm with poison, creating a colorful and shiny appearance that was impervious to blades and arrows. Each finger had a different poison, capable of quickly poisoning tea or turning sand into toxic dust with a simple grab.
<br><br>
Before the Purple Gold Hand, there was the Ten Thousand Poisonous Insects, and even earlier was the Arsenic Doctor.

### Feud with the Diancang Faction

Once upon a time, a pair of martial arts lovers had a dispute, dragging Tangmen's elders into the conflict. The Sword Saint of the Diancang faction passed by and intervened, but when he was bullied, he revealed his true skills, shocking everyone and gaining their respect. However, Tangmen's elders were furious and refused to listen to the Sword Saint, leading to a tragic end.
<br><br>
The leader of Tangmen, upon hearing this, took revenge by secretly poisoning and disabling the Sword Saint's martial arts. This act deepened the enmity between the two factions.

### Candle Skull

Among the three major families of the martial arts world, there used to be four, with the disappearance of the Yuwen family.
<br><br>
Legend has it that the Nangong and Yuwen families were once at odds, producing two geniuses—Nangong Liang and Yuwen Xin. They shared many adventures together, but due to an unfortunate incident caused by Tangmen's elder "Candle Skull" Tang Zhu, their love turned to enmity. With the burden of their family's tragic fate, only one of them could survive in the end.
<br><br>
In their final battle, the two clashed palms, testing their inner strength. Yuwen Xin, with a smile, secretly transferred his inner strength to heal Nangong Liang, willingly accepting the fatal blow. This soft inner strength continued to flow within Nangong Liang, blending with the family's inherited inner energy, becoming one, like a soulful guardian until old age. This is the highest realm of the Nangong Heart Technique, known as the "Oath of Harmony."

### Demon of Nansong Mountain

In his youth, Tang Zhongling once pursued a frivolous young nobleman who had offended his junior sister, Tang Lu, to Nansong Mountain.
<br><br>
The abbot, Shi Ming, out of compassion, sheltered the criminal, provoking a Tangmen villain to knock on the temple door dozens of times that night. Amidst thunder and lightning, shadows outside the window appeared devilish with each flash. The monks believed an evil spirit had descended upon them, chanting scriptures in unison. Tang Zhongling, despite his rebellious nature, showed great respect for the monks, reciting Buddhist scriptures without interruption. When dawn broke, he left without a word.
<br><br>
That day, the monks in the temple were all plagued by inner demons, including Shi Ming, who, despite returning the abbot's robe and staff, could not escape the nightmares. Fearing the horror within, he harbored thoughts of destroying Tangmen to rid himself of the terror.

### Rescue at the Execution Ground

Before assuming leadership, Tang Zhongling had a fateful encounter with Tang Sheng under a pavilion to seek shelter from the rain. Later, Tang Sheng offended a powerful figure, leading to his execution. On the way to the execution ground, Tang Zhongling, accompanied by the young Tang Buyi and Tang Zheng, saved Tang Sheng. Tang Zhongling publicly criticized the incompetence of the officials, and no one dared to speak against him.
<br><br>
Although the act of saving a righteous man from the executioner's blade was commendable, it also led to Tangmen being viewed as a thorn in the court's side for over a decade. Local officials dared not provoke Tangmen, and with the intervention of the Nangong family head, Tangmen was able to force the Sword Saint of the Diancang faction to retire without taking his life, in exchange for the faction's retreat. During this time, Tangmen's leader's wife passed away, plunging him into deep sorrow and enduring torment to this day.
<br><br>
Subsequently, due to the incident at the execution ground, the Emperor Zhao Kuo of the Great Song Dynasty became wary of Tangmen. He secretly weakened Tangmen through the Shangguan family and colluded with Shi Ming of Nansong Mountain and the Guangzhou Tangmen to launch a joint attack.

## Guangzhou Tangmen

Founded by the defector "Foshou Xiang" Tang Shouhong, with disciple Tang Shan.
<br><br>
Tangmen does not recognize this branch.

## Ten Thousand Spirit Oil

Tangmen possesses the Ten Thousand Spirit Oil, a vital elixir for travel. Its refreshing scent can invigorate the mind, cool in summer, warm in winter, and drinking it with water can treat diarrhea. Applying it to the wrist can ward off snakes and mosquitoes. It is considered a remedy for most difficult situations.
<br><br>
When refined into the Ten Thousand Spirit Pill, it becomes a life-saving elixir that can counteract poisons and eliminate all evils in the body. However, it is harmful if taken by someone not poisoned. If the Ten Thousand Spirit Oil is concentrated into a paste, its medicinal power is potent and long-lasting, making it the king of elixirs.
<br><br>
The Ten Thousand Spirit Oil has been lost along with the Tangmen Pharmacopoeia, later recreated by the Second Senior Brother, Tang Zheng.
<br><br>
Shangguan Jun once claimed that he took the Ten Thousand Spirit Pill in his youth and was immune to all poisons.

## Flying Swallow Shooting Star Feather

> "Feathers? Have you gone mad? Hahaha! Feathers can harm people? Unless—unless..."

While the legend of Tangmen was once the Ghostly Arrows and Yama's Talisman, it is now the unique skill "Flying Swallow Shooting Star Feather" created by Tang Zhongling himself. In his youth, the leader roamed the martial arts world with this technique, undefeated and feared, with only the leader and the eldest disciple Tang Buyi mastering it.

<br>

The notion that feathers can harm people should not be taken lightly, as internal energy can turn even flower petals into deadly weapons. However, this technique is too lethal, making it difficult to show mercy. On the other hand, the Ghostly Arrows and Yama's Talisman do not harm bystanders.

<br>

When the eldest disciple Tang Buyi used this technique to capture Tan Badao, he sliced the entire boat to pieces, puncturing Tan Badao's lungs, spleen, and stomach, severing the tendons in his right leg and cutting off four fingers on his right hand, nearly killing him. The power was truly shocking.

<br>

Upon his return, the Flying Swallow Shooting Star Feather clashed with the Phoenix Robe of Nangong Shen, slicing through steel and shattering joints, destroying the robe instantly, leaving the martial arts world in awe.

## Slogans

Words spoken by Tang Zhongling to the former martial arts alliance leader Long Yuan.

> "I am a commoner from the mountains, not bound by royal decrees. I have always gone against the norm, breaking rules and boundaries.<br>
> On a whim, I act freely. I believe I have not betrayed chivalry, with a clear conscience.<br>
> Good and evil reside within me, leaving my reputation to you all.<br>
> Tangmen does not conspire with others, not out of arrogance, but because the Tangmen legacy has remained steadfast from ancient times to the present."

The slogan shouted by Zhao Huo at the Wind and Rain Mountain Martial Arts Convention with his senior brothers and sisters.

> "Tangmen disciples—startling to hear!<br>
> Acting on a whim—robbing the rich to help the poor!<br>
> The leader punishes—stubborn and unyielding.<br>
> Rushing into bandit strongholds—plotting for wealth and harming lives!<br>
> Ruling Sichuan—standing out from the crowd!<br>
> Who dares provoke—fight your mother!!"

-   Also known as "Sugar Gate"
-   Besides poisons, Tangmen's laxatives are also miraculously effective like magic.
-   Tangmen disciples pay taxes on time.

-   Outpost residents may run businesses in the outpost, while others simply use it as affordable housing, seeking their livelihood elsewhere.
-   Before the Western Martial Arts War, the outpost residents would be evacuated, with the Fourth Senior Brother Tang Weiyuan deceiving them into going on a mountain excursion, profiting from the situation and calming the public anger.
-   The outpost residents are somewhat prepared for the aftermath of the Western Martial Arts War, knowing that this day was inevitable as they had always been under Tangmen's protection.

-   Tangmen's rescued individuals and daughters-in-law who married into Tangmen cannot practice Tangmen's martial arts or techniques but can improve their constitution by consuming medicinal diets.
-   Medicinal diets often taste spicy and numbing, enjoyable for those accustomed to it, but not forced on those who find it difficult to eat.
-   The kitchen or miscellaneous tasks have rotating schedules, more flexible than university timetables, with no penalties for skipping classes and the freedom to switch shifts if a replacement is found. Zhao Huo, though less restricted, is often coerced.
