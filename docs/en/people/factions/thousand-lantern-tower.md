</InfoList>

A legendary assassin organization, its existence is unknown to the world, whether it still exists or has disintegrated with the downfall of the old demonic sect. In reality, they are everywhere, lurking in the shadows, and no one has ever seen the true face of a Thousand Lantern Tower assassin and lived to tell the tale.

<br>

The Thousand Lantern Tower kidnaps children and trains them from a young age to become cold-blooded assassins, feeding them with corpse heart gu, causing excruciating pain when activated, ensuring their obedience. Furthermore, they have people secretly monitoring them, ready to erase all traces at the first sign of death or betrayal.

<br>

The Tower Master is the reincarnation of the former Blissful Sect leader, [[Shen Tulong]], who ranks disciples based on the number of incense sticks burned during the ceremony. When making an incision, he would chant:

> "Whose tomb is buried in the ancient temple, how many incense sticks are burned in the Thousand Lantern Tower?"<br>
> "A hundred years of life sealed in history, the Thousand Lantern Tower burns two incense sticks."

It is known that [[Jin Wu Shangren]] is the Head Instructor, second only to the Tower Master with five incense sticks, while [[Yu Xiaomei]] holds four incense sticks, and lower-ranking members must not disobey their superiors.

<br>

## Notes

- ~~Renamed to Thousand Roots Tower in the second creation~~
- The Tower Master of the Thousand Lantern Tower most fears [[Rui Xing|Xinghua Xian]], calling her "highly intelligent and close to demonic, suspected not to be human."
- After the siege of Jiangling, [[Rui Xing|Xinghua Xian]] ordered the Thousand Lantern Tower assassins to attack various sect bases, framing the Mud Sect. This indicates that Xinghua Xian has a certain level of control over the Thousand Lantern Tower.
- The Thousand Lantern Tower greatly fears the Tang Sect. The Tang Sect is skilled in poisoning and using hidden weapons to kill invisibly. If they turn light into darkness and disperse to various locations, they would be the most terrifying assassin organization on earth.
- Although most texts describe [[Yu Xiaomei|Xiaomei]] as the fourth generation, she is referred to as the fifth generation in front of [[Shen Tulong]], for unknown reasons.
- [[Yu Xiaomei|Xiaomei]] was scolded by [[Shen Tulong]] as the worst among all generations of Thousand-Faced Demons, lacking determination and strength.
- Zhao Huo's face is too ugly, suspected to be a Thousand-Faced Demon wearing a human skin mask.
- Currently, the Thousand Lantern Tower's power in the plot seems weak, but Niao Xiong states that they are a mysterious assassin organization that will not easily reveal themselves to the public. [^1]
