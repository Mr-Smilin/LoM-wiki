</InfoList>

A sect that has been exterminated, located in the Great Snow Mountain.
<br><br>
The martial arts of the Snow Mountain Sect excel in internal energy and swordsmanship. The Snow Mountain Heart Technique aims to dissolve force, circulate internal energy for warmth, and dispel the bone-chilling cold of the snow-covered land.
<br><br>
Xiahou, the head of the Snow Mountain Sect, had a deep friendship with the head of the Shangguan family, [[Shangguan Jun]], and they once made a marriage agreement.

## Extermination

> "Isn't it ridiculous? What's there to fight about? These brainless and sensational things are what the martial world is all about."

It all started with an insignificant argument. One day, disciples of the Snow Mountain Sect encountered people from the Kongtong Sect at an inn. The Kongtong disciples teased that Kongtong was colder in winter than the Snow Mountain Sect, leading to an argument and a fight. With blades and swords having no eyes, someone was accidentally killed, and both sides became bloodthirsty, seeking more people to settle the score, escalating the conflict.
<br><br>
The Snow Mountain Sect once sought help from the [[Shangguan Family]], but [[Shangguan Jun|the head of the Shangguan family]] used the excuse of a distant journey to coldly watch from the sidelines. In the end, the Snow Mountain Sect was exterminated by the [[Kongtong Sect]], the only daughter of the sect leader, [[Xiahou Lan|Xiahou Mei]], was taken away, renamed [[Xiahou Lan]], and became the successor disciple. The culprit from the Feitian Sect died in the chaos of the Snow Mountain battle, and the one who killed the sect leader had their head twisted off by her after she reached great martial prowess, hanging their corpse in the rain screen to dry into a mummy.
<br><br>
Everything at the site was burned by a great fire and buried under heavy snow, except for five large rocks of the Plum Blossom Stake and a snow tree, nothing else remained.
<br><br>
As for the disciple [[Third Xiang]] who escaped, the encounter with [[Xiahou Lan]] on the Kongtong Mountain is a story for another time.

## Techniques

- [[Soul-Stealing Phantom Claw]]
- [[Snow Mountain Flying Crane Claw]]
- [[Cloud-Ascending, Moon-Gazing]]
- [[Snow Mountain Heart Technique]]

## Notes

- In the game, the Great Snow Mountain is located near the Kongtong Mountain in Gansu, far from the real Snow Mountain range in Sichuan. It is speculated to be in another mountain range, as confirmed by Niaoxiong.
- If following the storyline of [[Xiahou Lan]], [[Zhao Huo]] is the senior disciple of the Snow Mountain Sect, and there is a chance for [[Fan Xiaotian]] to become the junior sister of the Snow Mountain Sect.
- Despite the Snow Mountain Swordsmanship, [[Xiahou Lan]] never draws her sword and only uses palm techniques. In the game, only [[Zhao Huo]] and [[Jie Wuchen]] mention the Snow Mountain Sect and display a few moves, without any secret techniques.
