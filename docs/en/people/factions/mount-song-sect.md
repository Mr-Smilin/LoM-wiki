As the leader of the Central Plains' Six Major Sects, the Songshan Sect suffered a great loss of vitality in the battle against the Old Demon Sect, leading to the rise of the Quanzhen Sect. Monks and abbots from various temples across the land successively returned to secular life, converted to other beliefs, or wandered away from the temples. Temples with declining incense offerings were subsequently abandoned throughout the land.
<br><br>
Songshan is divided into the Main Temple in Henan (Northern Temple) and the Branch Temple in Fujian (Southern Temple). Both practice Buddhism, but have governed themselves independently since the establishment of their temples, rarely interfering with each other. However, people in the martial world often confuse the two, thinking they are the same entity. During the battle against the Old Demon Sect, the Main Temple sacrificed itself for righteousness, while the Branch Temple did not contribute much but still benefited from the Main Temple's reputation.
<br><br>
The Songshan Sect in Fujian is wealthy, while the one in Henan is poor. The Main Temple in Henan was occupied by the Jin Dynasty, and its precious temples were destroyed. Efforts are still ongoing to raise funds for reconstruction. Some even argue that the Songshan Sect in Fujian is the true representative of the Songshan Sect of the Song Dynasty, and that the Songshan Sect in Henan should no longer be considered the leader of the Six Major Sects.

## Songshan Martial Arts

Songshan is the origin of martial arts in the world, with techniques such as the Golden Bell Cover, Lion's Roar Technique, Muscle Changing Classic, Eagle Claw, Diamond Leg, Iron Sand Palm, and more, all renowned as exceptional skills. However, Songshan's martial arts have now spread widely throughout the martial world, and can even be purchased by those with affinity at roadside stalls.
<br><br>
If one were to identify the most formidable technique, it would be the ancient and modern supreme skill, the invisible energy of the body-breaking technique, the Songshan Sect's secret technique, "Diamond Divine Spear Finger." However, the Songshan Sect fell in the battle against the Old Demon Sect twenty years ago. Whether this technique has been lost or not, and whether it truly exists, remains a topic of debate. Along with the Kunlun Swordsmanship, it has become a legend in the martial world, with many doubters. As a result, most people consider the "Nayuta Finger" to be the highest martial art.
<br><br>
The leader of the Beggar's Sect, Wang Erzhuang, is a lay disciple of the Songshan Sect and the heir of the Spring Dream Master. He mastered the Diamond Divine Spear Finger and persuaded Rui Sheng to retreat with just one finger during the Battle of Jiangling. The senior brother of the Woyun Mountain, Tang Buyi, once pierced through the bodyguard's hard energy with a single strike, but in reality, he used the hidden weapon "Invisible Arrow."

## Inner Demon of the Southern Temple

Many years ago, Shi Ming was originally a virtuous high monk who took over as the abbot of the Southern Temple of Songshan at a young age. Due to a compassionate act of sheltering an enemy of the Tang Clan, he provoked Tang Zhongling to urgently knock on the temple door outside, amidst thunder and lightning that illuminated shadowy figures resembling demons with each flash.
<br><br>
The monks believed that evil spirits had descended, and chanted scriptures together. Although the abbot had a temperamental nature, he showed extreme respect for the monks and the Buddha, never ceasing his chanting. He remained silent until dawn before leaving.
<br><br>
That day, not a single monk in the temple was free from inner demons, including Shi Ming. He returned the abbot's robe and Zen staff, renounced his position, and traveled the world to spread the Dharma. However, after several decades, he still could not rid himself of nightmares. Fearing terror, he harbored evil thoughts and schemed to destroy the Tang Clan.

## Eighteen Bronze Men

> "The eighteen of us are the most rugged path in your life!"

The Eighteen Bronze Arhats Formation, each holding a staff, stands in the front. Monks cannot walk out of the Wooden Man Alley, and laypeople cannot enter the Arhat Hall.
<br><br>
In the Western Wulin Line, if Fuyun's favorability rating is 2â˜…, the Songshan Eighteen Bronze Men will appear. Each of the Eighteen Bronze Men excels in different weapons, such as knives, spears, staffs, swords, and shovels. Fuyun uses his mouth, which can move mountains and rivers, making him extremely formidable.
<br><br>
Although these golden monks do not kill, their attacks are far from merciful. When they unleash all eighteen martial arts on themselves, it becomes clear that this group of golden bald donkeys is not to be trifled with. Even those without inner demons can be driven to madness when mentioned in the Wooden Man Alley, causing tremors among the disciples of Songshan.
<br><br>
The gold paint is applied to boost courage and maintain prestige.
