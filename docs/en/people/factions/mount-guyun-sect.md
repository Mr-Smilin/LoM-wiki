> "When all the birds have flown high, and the solitary cloud drifts leisurely. Gazing at each other, only the Jingtian Mountain remains."

A small sect unknown to many, until the young sect leader [[Ruisheng]] emerged.
<br><br>
Sitting alone on the Jingtian Mountain, where could Li Bai sit to gaze at the Jingtian Mountain without getting tired? That would be the Solitary Cloud Mountain across.
<br><br>
Li Bai, both a poet and a swordsman, danced with his sword in wine. Upon waking up, he found that he had unexpectedly taken on a disciple named Wu'e. With no valid reason to retract, he calmly informed his disciple that this sect must be passed down in a single line, with only one successor per generation. And so, the Solitary Cloud Sect remained obscure until the era of living heroes.
<br><br>
The sect's ultimate skill is the Taibai Immortal Traces.
