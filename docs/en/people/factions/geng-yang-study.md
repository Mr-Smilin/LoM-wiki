> Shengping can sing and dance, but does not write poetry in chaotic times. Rather be an incapable minister in a peaceful era than a useful one in a corrupt court.

The publication of the "Jianghu Express" in each issue has caused continuous turmoil in the martial arts world.
<br><br>
The literati of Gengyang Study Room, with unparalleled pride, are all recluses with outstanding talents in the contemporary world. They work in the fields, indifferent to worldly affairs, and uninterested in fame and power. Even when Prime Minister Shi Miyuan sent someone to invite them, they were all driven out of the study room by a mob.
<br><br>
The master of the study room once said, "Shengping can sing and dance, but does not write poetry in chaotic times. Rather be an incapable minister in a peaceful era than a useful one in a corrupt court." They will only come out of seclusion when there are no more frozen bones in the world, to sing praises of peace throughout the four seas. Otherwise, they would rather die than accept a salary from the court, to demonstrate that their study is to serve the heavens, earth, and humanity, rather than to serve a mere monarch.

## Jianghu Express

> "This is a matter recorded in the Jianghu Express! Do you dare not believe the great scholars of Gengyang Study Room?"

To know the latest news in the martial arts world, one must read the newspaper.
<br><br>
Issued monthly, the content includes not only anecdotes from the martial arts world but also serialized martial arts novels, with a mix of truth and fiction known only to those involved.
<br><br>
[[Zhao Huo]] can be purchased from [[Tang Weiyuan|Fourth Senior Brother]] for the price of 950 wen.

### Stamps

Gengyang Study Room has always only written the Jianghu Express, and other treasures of ink are hard to come by.
<br><br>
At the beginning of the publication, due to a lack of funds, an agreement was made to promote the newspaper. Loyal readers who collect the special stamps from the inaugural issue can send them back to Gengyang Study Room to exchange for calligraphy and paintings from famous artists.
<br><br>
The inaugural issue is extremely rare, with only a hundred copies distributed, and it is unknown how many have been trampled and destroyed in the world. [[Tang Sheng]], as a scholar, began buying them from the inaugural issue and only stopped buying them in the last two years. There is a chance that Nangong Shouyan will use his stamps to exchange for calligraphy and paintings as gifts.

## Secrets

## Notes

- The ghostly talismanic paintings of [[Zhao Huo]] were thought by Gengyang Study Room to possibly be the handiwork of Du Fu, prompting further research upon purchase.
- [[Wei Ju]], [[Shangguan Ying]], and [[Nangong Shen]] once studied together here.
- In search of [[Wang Erzhuang]], Nangong Yuan once placed a missing person ad.
- At the end of the martial arts legend, Gengyang Study Room compiled the deeds of [[Zhao Huo]] into a book, published and titled "The Legend of Huo Xia".
