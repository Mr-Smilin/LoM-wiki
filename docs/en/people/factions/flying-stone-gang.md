</InfoList>

A rapidly rising gang in recent years, with no restrictions on recruitment, attracting people from all walks of life. A mix of good and bad, they operate in the gray area between right and wrong. Although the gang members are ruffians, they engage in legitimate business, specializing in providing labor for manual work.

<br>

Lacking internal martial arts skills, they cannot compete with righteous martial artists in combat, but their strength lies in numbers, with one thug after another ready to fight. The gang leader, [[Master Shi Gongyuan|Flying Stone Gang Leader]], is known for his extremely domineering external martial arts skills and is a man who knows right from wrong.

<br>

Due to various reasons, they often clash with the [[Tang Sect]].
<br clear="all">

## Origin

The gang leader, [[Master Shi Gongyuan]], once served in the military, but deserted and ended up at Tengyun Mountain in Tanzhou. During a robbery, he met [[Lady Shi|Daughter of the Magistrate]], who offered herself as collateral until her father redeemed her with money. The leader of the Shi gang fell in love at first sight, treated her with fine wine and food, kept his promise to the official's daughter, but her father thought she had been dishonored and led troops to besiege Tengyun Mountain.

<br>

In the chaos of battle, the bandits scattered and fled, with the leader of the Shi gang shielding the official's daughter in the fire, his body pierced with arrows, until he delivered her to the officials, and only then did his brothers pull him away and he fled. Lady Shi was also a woman of deep feelings, after reporting to her father, she turned and ran into the fire, following the leader of the Shi gang down the mountain, willingly accompanying him into the jianghu.

<br>

They traveled west to Shuzhong, unsure of how to make a living. They had to avoid the authorities and couldn't do business. The locals, seeing their fierce appearance and non-local origins, were afraid to hire them. At that time, the Tang Sect took them in, not making much money, but enough to make a living, turning their lives around from despair, abandoning thoughts of taking risks. Eventually, they established the Flying Stone Gang, specializing in taking on manual labor and odd jobs for others to make a living.

## Lady Shi's Departure

As the gang grew, Lady Shi began to have thoughts of dealing with the Tang Sect. To become the top power in Shuzhong, they had to surpass the Tang Sect, a formidable obstacle.

<br>

[[Master Shi Gongyuan|Gang Leader Shi]] advised Lady Shi with kind words, reminding her not to forget gratitude. As the argument grew heated, Lady Shi repeatedly slapped the gang leader, who couldn't hold back and accidentally brushed her face with his finger. Lady Shi was filled with bitterness, tears welling up in her eyes, and she left in a huff. The gang leader, lost for words, didn't dare to follow, and when he finally came to his senses to chase after her, Lady Shi was nowhere to be found.

<br>

[[Tang Buyi]], who unexpectedly witnessed the scene, secretly followed to protect Lady Shi, speaking kindly to her and persuading her to abandon thoughts of suicide, arranging a place for her to stay. But Lady Shi, stubborn as a mule, refused to come out for a long time. The gang leader thought the flying swordsman had taken Lady Shi away, turning a small domestic matter into a feud between two factions.

<br>

Finally, in order to lure Lady Shi out of hiding in Ciyun An, Tang Buyi arranged a decisive battle with Gang Leader Shi at Woyun Hill. If the misunderstanding was resolved, the couple would visit Tang Buyi's grave in the future to pay their respects and join the Tang Sect. Otherwise, if Lady Shi saw Tang Buyi killed by Gang Leader Shi, she would cut her hair and become a nun, vowing never to see him again, leading to continued conflict between the two factions.

## Notes

- Deep♂Rock♂Fantasy: [Link](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=172733621791491&set=a.117318193999701)
- By the third year of the game, in terms of numbers alone, the Flying Stone Gang had surpassed the [[Cang Gang]] and the [[White Shark Gang]], second only to the [[Beggar Gang]], with tens of thousands of members.
- The Flying Stone Gang even employed sedan chair bearers, with new sedan chairs and spirited workers, making life difficult for other aging sedan chair bearers. Not only in Shuzhong, but there was also a branch of the Flying Stone Gang in Jiangling, hiring many gang members at the ferry.
- Some of the Flying Stone Gang members have a grudge against the [[Tang Sect]] out of jealousy. Growing up in Shuzhong, they aspire to walk with the same prestige as the Tang Sect disciples. After resolving past grievances, they can now march together to the battlefield, proud and united.
