One of the Seven Immortals of Joy, son of the "Strange Ape in the Wind" [[Yuan Cheng Feng]].
<br><br>
After his mother was disfigured by Yuan Cheng Feng, she fled to the Jinxiang Palace while pregnant. Along the way, Yuan Wu Xian was born and washed away in a river. He was picked up by monkeys in the mountains to be raised, then captured by hunters and eventually ended up in the Kingdom of Jin, where he and a monkey were kept in a cage to perform on the streets, barely surviving.
<br><br>
Upon his mother's arrival at Jinxiang Palace, she favored [[Nan Gong Qian]] and sent him to the Nan Gong family in place of [[Madame Wen]]. After Yuan Wu Xian learned about his origins, he harbored hatred towards Nan Gong Qian. Together with [[Jing Hong]], they stole a letter from the Beggar's Sect and orchestrated a plan that led to Nan Gong Qian unwittingly causing Madame Wen's demise.

## Remarks

-   The claim that Madame Wen is Nan Gong Qian's birth mother is currently only based on Yuan Wu Xian's account and is unverified.
-   He claims to be a member of the Emei faction with no known name, belonging to the same generation as [[Xiang Wu You|Master Xiang]].
-   He was harshly criticized by [[Zhao Huo]] as a mountain monkey who excels in cultivation.
-   As of the current storyline (v1.0.3200), it is not specified which faction he belongs to, but it is speculated that like his father, he is associated with the Joyful Sect.
