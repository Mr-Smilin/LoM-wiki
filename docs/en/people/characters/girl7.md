## Biography

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Biography One">
	Prior to the previous sect leader's passing, she was specially invited from Gengyang Study Hall as a distant relative, <br>
	formerly known as Ju, to succeed as the Xuangong Sect Leader and the direct female disciple.<br><br>
	Despite her gentle appearance and ever-smiling demeanor, she is adept at managing subordinates, <br>
	currently serving as the Kongtong Sect librarian, overseeing profound texts and all household records, livestock, and finances, <br>
	with her presence ensuring order within the sect.<br><br>
	Never engaging in combat, she is highly respected by all levels of the sect, <br>
	rumored to possess extraordinary martial arts skills that astound the world, <br>
	even causing the formidable Feitian Sect Leader, Huolong Xianjun, to regard this young lady with caution.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Two">
	As a contemporary talented woman who excelled despite her gender, <br>
	her reputation as Wei the Talented is well-known throughout Jinling City.<br>
	Receiving gifts worth a fortune daily, countless scholars vie for her attention, <br>
	but this talented woman, well-read and proud, often declines meetings with difficult couplets.<br><br>
	Like many literati, she holds herself in high regard, aspiring for greatness, <br>
	passing the imperial examination with top honors, becoming a student of the emperor, <br>
	shocking the court with her eloquent three thousand essays and achieving the top scholar title.<br><br>
	While she may not receive official titles like Lin Youyu, <br>
	she is considered a remarkable figure akin to Wu Zhiduan, proving her astonishing talent.<br>
	The court officials, tired of these talented women outshining them, <br>
	feeling inadequate, used their influence to decree, "This woman is talented and beautiful, suitable to be wed to Dexuan Jiewei," a military officer of eighth rank.<br>
	Admiring her reputation, yet tainted by the infamy of causing his previous wife's death, <br>
	the man was rejected by Wei the Talented, only gaining entry into her household after paying a hefty sum.<br><br>
	On their wedding night, Wei the Talented wept bitterly, seeking to preserve her honor, unable to find a white silk cloth, <br>
	upon opening the door, she discovered all thirty members of her family had hanged themselves.<br>
	Under the swaying bodies, the Apricot Blossom Fairy beckoned with a smile, inviting her to join.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Three">
	Accompanied by the Apricot Blossom Fairy to observe court proceedings in the Wendian Hall, <br>
	she realized that the royal court she had long admired was as corrupt as a muddy swamp.<br><br>
	These pampered and aloof officials, living carefree lives, indulging in elegance, all eloquence and sophistication, <br>
	are oblivious to the hardships of the common people and the tragedies at the borders, using them merely as literary subjects.<br><br>
	The principles in books, to the literati of the time, were superficial, <br>
	arrogant and disdainful, poeticizing romance while looking down on the common folk, <br>
	claiming to have integrity without any real strength, boasting of their moral character.<br><br>
	Every soldier who died at the borders had integrity, everyone faces death, <br>
	why do the history books only remember your names, esteemed ministers? Because historians are also literati.<br><br>
	Wei Ju traveled from Xiangyang to Lin'an Prefecture, weeping uncontrollably, <br>
	abandoning her aspirations to serve in the court, swearing<br>
	"To sing and dance in times of peace, not to write poetry in times of chaos.<br>
	 Better to be useless in a peaceful era than a useful minister in a corrupt court."<br><br>
	Despite this, she often succumbs to the temptation to express herself eloquently, <br>
	managing to rectify her mistakes in time, avoiding breaking her vow of not writing poetry.<br><br>
	She can gladly work in the fields with illiterate peasants, <br>
	but she looks down upon literati who consider themselves talented after reading a few books, <br>
	her ability to control her temper is a testament to her exceptional cultivation.
