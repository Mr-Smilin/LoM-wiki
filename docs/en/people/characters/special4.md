## Biography

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Biography One">
	A rising star in the Beggar Gang in recent years.<br><br>
	She firmly believes in the law of the jungle, where the weak are destined to be oppressed, and only the strong can survive in this world. Despite her small size, she fights like a mad dog, using fists, claws, knees, and elbows in every move, fearless and ruthless. She has a set of "Dog Beating Fist" techniques, with a crude name but clever techniques, focusing on one principle: "ruthless," aiming to beat people to death with every move.<br><br>
	Once, she followed an elderly Eight-Bag Elder when he got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, and brutally beat him, breaking his limbs and pushing him into a dung pit.<br><br>
	After that incident, even the elders with seniority in the gang dared not show disrespect in front of her, because this person is truly crazy. Regardless of gender or age, she dares to challenge even the Emperor of the Great Song.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Two">
	She is also an outsider in the Beggar Gang, with no close peers and very few people who can advise her.<br><br>
	Due to her inability to sing well or beg successfully since childhood, she would have starved to death if not for the care of the old beggar "Uncle." Perhaps for this reason, she only listens to Uncle, appearing wild in front of others but very obedient by Uncle's side.<br><br>
	Although she is not close to people, she seems to like small animals, often seen sharing hard-earned food with stray animals.<br><br>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Three">
	The incident of beating the Eight-Bag Elder had a reason behind it.<br><br>
	She is a descendant of the Khitan Liao people who destroyed a country a hundred years ago. Since birth, she only remembers wandering the Central Plains with her parents, and those memories have become very vague now.<br><br>
	After her parents passed away, only an old dog named "Ah Hua" was left for her. Ah Hua was very intelligent, protecting her from mosquitoes and snakes when she was young, accompanying her day and night, like family.<br><br>
	One day, she woke up in the middle of the night, only to find Ah Hua missing and the old beggars eating dog meat soup. She was lost and cried for a long time.<br><br>
	From that day on, she became aloof, with nothing left to lose.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Four">
	Her name is "Fan Xieyan," given by her mother after learning Chinese, hoping she would live carefreely and smile brightly.<br><br>
	However, she unfortunately encountered evil beggars who specialized in abducting and mutilating young girls. They intended to turn her into a "human-dog," but her natural beauty made them change their minds and kept her as a forbidden toy, hidden in the beggar's den for their amusement until she matured enough to be used.<br>
	Thanks to the intervention of Gang Leader Wang, their plan did not come to fruition, but being treated like a dog left her physically and mentally scarred.<br><br>
	Perhaps there is a paradise in this world, even with constant border conflicts, there is a corner of peace; there are night markets when it gets dark, there is light, there is a home to return to, but there is nowhere she truly belongs.
	Until your appearance.<br><br>
	She believes in you, loyal and devoted, as you are her only family.

## Notes

-   [[Uncle]] is an old beggar whose name is unknown, referred to as Uncle Dog by Mad Dog.
-   Due to [[Uncle]]'s influence, she was raised as an old-school enforcer for the Beggar Gang, appearing submissive on the surface but still seeking revenge for her dog Ah Hua that was eaten.
-   Received some martial arts training from the sub-leader, [[Wang Erzhuang|Gang Leader]], and [[Long Yuan|Uncle Long]].
-   Raised many dogs and once worked with [[Li Fugui]] at the [[Feishi Gang]] to earn money to cover the cost of feeding them.
-   During her time at the [[Kongtong Sect]], she was poached by the Iron Fist Sect with bone-roasted meat to be a fighter in the third round of the Seasonal Trials.
-   If [[Zhao Huo]] is Master [[Xiahou Lan]], there is a chance for Mad Dog to join the [[Snow Mountain Sect]], the only route to discover that Mad Dog is a woman.
-   Before the Snow Mountain journey, [[Xiahou Lan]] noticed that [[Li Fugui]] was particularly caring for her, surrounded by a bunch of dogs. Unable to bring them all, she was not called.
-   In the hopeless storyline, fearing that she would cause trouble at the main headquarters for the [[Tang Sect]], the sub-leader gave her a fake title, "Bi Gou Wen." She specifically visits various divisions of the Beggar Gang, establishes a stray dog shelter, and advocates against eating dog meat, showing great enthusiasm.
-   If Mad Dog has a high favorability but the Beggar Gang does not support the Tang Sect and [[Li Fugui]] has low favorability, Mad Dog has a chance to join the final battle of the Tang Sect.
