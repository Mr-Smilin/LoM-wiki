> "Shi Gongyuan, you're dead, when I can move, you're dead! Watch me bite off your nipples!"

Wife of the leader of the Flying Stone Gang, with a fiery personality.

<br>

Originally the daughter of a magistrate, she encountered the bandits led by Tanzhou Tengyun Village's [[石公遠]] while traveling with her father for his new post, and bravely followed the leader of the village back. The village leader fell in love with her at first sight, and treated her with great hospitality. Ten days later, thinking his daughter had been dishonored, the magistrate led soldiers to besiege the bandits. In the chaos, the village leader was riddled with arrows, protecting the official's daughter and bringing her to the soldiers. The daughter, being devoted and loyal, just reported her safety to her father and then ran into the fire to escape with him, willingly following him into the world of jianghu.

<br>

They traveled west to Shu, unfamiliar with the place and had to avoid officials, nearly starving. They were taken in by the Tang Clan's fields at the time. Although they didn't earn much, it was enough to survive and turn their lives around from desperation, abandoning thoughts of taking risks. Eventually, they were able to establish their own foothold, founding the Flying Stone Gang, specializing in taking on rough and miscellaneous tasks to make a living.

<br>

However, as the gang grew, Lady Shi began to have thoughts of dealing with the [[Tang Clan]]. To become the top power in Shu, they had to surpass the Tang Clan's barrier. [[石公遠|The gang leader]] advised Lady Shi kindly, reminding her not to forget gratitude. As the argument escalated, unable to withstand Lady Shi's repeated slaps, the gang leader accidentally brushed his finger on Lady Shi's cheek, leaving her full of bitterness and tears in her eyes, storming off. By the time the gang leader came to his senses, Lady Shi was nowhere to be found.

<br>

[[唐布衣]], who witnessed this scene, secretly followed to protect Lady Shi, trying to persuade her to give up thoughts of jumping off a cliff, and arranging a place for her to stay. Little did they know, Lady Shi was as stubborn as a mule and refused to come out for a long time. [[石公遠|The gang leader]] thought the flying thief had taken Lady Shi away, turning a small domestic matter into a dispute between two factions.

<br>

In the end, [[唐布衣]] arranged a showdown between Lady Shi, who was staying at Ciyun An, and [[石公遠|the gang leader]] at Woyun Hill.

## Notes

- When [[趙活]] accompanied the eldest senior brother to Woyun Hill, if his beloved was [[上官螢]], seeing Lady Shi would make them look very similar, except Lady Shi was a bit older.
- [[石公遠]] once said, when she gets angry, she's like a fierce lion from Hedong, extremely fierce.
