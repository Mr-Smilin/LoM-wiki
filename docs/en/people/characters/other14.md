<br>

Following in the footsteps of her older sister, she joined the [[Tang Sect]], but her seniority is one generation lower than her sister.

<br>

[[Tang Zheng|Second Senior Brother]] treated a female patient, and in order to avoid suspicion, deliberately cultivated Tang Fang to learn acupuncture techniques. As a result, Tang Fang became the most skilled female disciple in contemporary medicine in the [[Tang Sect]].

<br>

However, she is the queen of tardiness, always late out of habit, and doesn't feel sorry even when she is late.

## Notes

-   Not yet implemented (v3206), information on Niaoxiong FB public on 2024/10/5: [Link](https://www.facebook.com/100076301525150/posts/554404723779574)
-   Assigned by Second Senior Brother to treat [[Ye Yunshang]] with acupuncture, a female disciple of the Tang Sect[^1]
-   When her older sister joined the [[Tang Sect]], she was a disciple of the previous generation, so for Tang Fang, she is a younger senior sister[^1]
-   Usually busy and often late, she rarely interacts with [[Zhao Huo]], so she is a limited-route character[^1]
-   [[Tang Buyi|First Senior Brother]] and [[Tang Zheng|Second Senior Brother]] once had a crush on her sister[^1]
-   She is considered a senior sister by Zhao Huo[^2]
-   If scolded for being late, she will jokingly say in a slightly impatient tone, "Alright, alright, otherwise next time I'll treat you to a drink."[^3]
-   She really will treat others, but not very willingly[^7]
-   She is quite indifferent to love, the type that will easily marry herself off when her parents agree due to her age[^4]
-   Her buttocks are slightly larger than average[^5]
-   Although [[Tang Zheng|Second Senior Brother]] once had a crush on her sister, he is still quite strict with Tang Fang[^6]
-   Her hairstyle of covering one eye is learned from [[Tang Zheng|Second Senior Brother]], and she thinks it's cool[^6]
-   She is quite skilled in medicine, spanning across the vast Central Plains, it's not easy to find a doctor more skilled than her[^8]
