> "What of it? To act as a human is enough. I am the embodiment of human evil, so what?"

The Apricot Blossom Fairy, residing in the Apricot Blossom Forest in Nanyang, is shrouded in mystery, unspeakable.
<br><br>
As a woman, she serves as the current head of the Rui family, using the Apricot Blossom Purse to help those in need and dispel confusion.
<br><br>
The storms of the martial world and even the wars of the four nations are all orchestrated by this person behind the scenes. She manipulates the world like a chessboard, playing against Madam Wen, Zhao Kuo, Wan Yan Xun, and Genghis Khan. All beings are pawns in her game, with no control over life and death.
<br><br>
Blood rain falls upon her arrival, devastation follows her departure - this is the human embodiment of evil, the Apricot Blossom Fairy.

## Notes

-   ~~Ugly fetish~~
-   The original owner of the Jinxiang Palace, at the age of eleven, used this palace as a gift to apprentice herself to Madam Wen of the Jinxiang Pavilion to learn about human nature.
-   Continuing from Madam Wen's statement at the Wulin Conference about "the ten years borrowed from the Apricot Blossom Fairy," Rui Xing is suspected to be twenty-one years old.
-   Even [[Zhao Kuo|Emperor of the Song Dynasty]] must bow down humbly.
-   She has a fondness for Zhao Huo, willing to pluck stars for him, but the extent of her love is a secret.
-   Opening the Apricot Blossom Purse in a dream will forcefully change the object of affection.
-   [[Wan Li Peng Cheng|Eagle Man]] and [[Wu Ming|Point Cang Sword Saint]] carry her palanquin.
-   Has a maid, [[Shu Rong]].
-   As the head of the Rui family, she demands that Rui Sheng acknowledge her as his sister, and if he refuses, he will be removed from the family tree.
-   The Rui family is isolated from the world, claiming to be timeless in the mountains, so Rui Xing wears clothing similar to the previous dynasty's ruqun. The fabric is breathable material from the Western Regions, plain in appearance but actually quite valuable.
-   She dislikes spending time on elaborate hairstyles and hair accessories. Shu Rong usually helps her put them on when she is lost in thought.
