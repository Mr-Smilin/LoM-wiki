As the leader of the Qingcheng Sect, Zou Bo is passionate and practices the authentic "Can Tong Mi Qi" of the Xuanmen sect, with profound skills. However, after becoming the sect leader and managing the sect, he gained hundreds of pounds due to the stress and strain, and his strength is no longer what it used to be.
<br><br>
At the Qingcheng Dao Conference more than twenty years ago, the Fire Dragon Immortal Lord misinterpreted the Dao principles, causing Zou Bo's junior brother Zhao Kui to fall into depravity, eventually becoming the King of Hell Dao in the Nidi Sect. Zou Bo wished to kill him on Mount Kongtong as soon as possible.
<br><br>
He called Nangong Yuan a worthy younger brother and brought him a Huanxu Dan at the birthday banquet. Upon witnessing Nangong Yuan's death at the Fengyu Mountain Martial Arts Conference, he became disheartened and contemplated retiring from the martial arts world.

## Notes

-   When he was young, he was tall and handsome, with a bit of a rogue vibe. He had a strong sense of justice, but later realized he couldn't continue down that path, so he worked hard and achieved what he has today. [^1]
