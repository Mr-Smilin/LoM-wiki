> "How could I dare to deceive? Evil spirits do exist. The demons arise from the heart. By driving Tang donor to commit numerous killings, those chants of Buddhist scriptures are meant to dispel the demon in donor's heart."

Shi Ming, a Zen master who has been practicing Buddhism for decades, is widely known.
<br><br>
In his youth, he served as the abbot of the Fujian branch temple of Mount Song Sect (South Mount Song). Due to his compassionate act of sheltering a criminal, the leader of the Tang Clan's demonic faction urgently knocked on the temple gate outside, with thunder and lightning that night. Each flash of light revealed shadowy figures outside the window, resembling demons. The monks all believed that evil spirits had descended, chanting scriptures in unison. Tang Zhongling, with a peculiar temperament, showed great respect for the monks and Buddha, continuously chanting Buddhist scriptures. He remained silent until dawn. On that day, not a single monk in the temple was free from inner demons, including Shi Ming himself. Despite returning the abbot's robe and Zen staff, he wandered the world to spread the Dharma. However, after several decades, he still could not escape nightmares. Fearing terror, he harbored evil thoughts, plotting to destroy the Tang Clan.
<br><br>
After Tang Zhongling fell ill, he sought refuge with the Shangguan Family to gain support, attempting to seize power from the [[Guangzhou Tang Clan|Tang Shouhong]]. Following a failed attempt, he slandered the Tang Clan with Chao He at the martial arts alliance meeting. In order to silence Fuyun, he resorted to underhanded tactics and knocked him down despite their camaraderie.
<br><br>
If Zhao Huo were to shout insults at the martial arts alliance meeting, it would scare people into thinking he was the one closest to the old Tang demon.

## End

In the final battle of the Western martial arts world, Shi Ming faced death in a confrontation with Zhao Huo, or he planned to escape the country out of fear of retaliation from the Tang Clan, only to be caught by the White Shark Gang and fed to the sharks.

## Notes

-   Shangguan Ying studied Buddhism and martial arts at the Fujian branch temple of Mount Song, guided by Shi Ming.
-   If Tan Badao's past is exposed at the Southern Palace banquet, and he falls from grace, he will seek Shi Ming's protection.
