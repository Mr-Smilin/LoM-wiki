> "A grass carp sells for two hundred wen without ever bargaining. Why does everyone think it's expensive and say I'm ripping them off?"

Originally from Cang Gang, he has a violent temper. He traveled by boat from Min River to Shu region, where he got into a dispute with his companions over red rice due to moisture. Later, he caught a few fish to sell, but set a high price that only Cang Gang members could afford, and was caught by [[Fu Yun]] when being taught a lesson, witnessed by [[Zhao Huo]].
<br><br>
Depending on the choice, he will join Tang Sect and change his name to Tang Da Jing, acknowledging [[Zhao Huo]] as his younger brother, or he will be stabbed to death and have the secret manual stolen.

## Notes

-   In the current version (v1.0.3131), he doesn't have many scenes, maybe we have to wait until Cang Gang finishes writing?
