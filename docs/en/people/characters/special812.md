Nicknamed "Buddha's Fragrance," originally named Zhuang, he is the senior brother of [[Tang Zhong Ling]]. In the past, when the [[Tang Clan]] faced difficulties, he disregarded loyalty and fled the mountain, becoming a selfish traitor.

<br>

After leaving the mountain, he settled in Guangzhou, accepted [[Tang Shan]] as a disciple, and founded the Guangzhou Tang Clan. Seeing the decline of the [[Tang Clan]] in Shu, he conspired with [[Shi Ming]] and the [[Shangguan Family]] to seize power from the [[Tang Clan]], but was ultimately defeated.

<br>

If caught by the [[Tang Clan]] in Shu during internal strife, he would be taken to the ancestral hall to be executed, and to avoid torture, he would disable his martial arts, retire from the martial world, and become a monk.

## Notes

-   If confronted by [[Tang Zhong Ling]], he would be swiftly defeated by the Flying Swallow Meteor Dart, depending on the sect leader's condition, he may be injured and taken away or have his tendons cut off.
-   If facing [[Xiahou Lan]], she would severely injure him.
-   Furthermore, if [[Yu Xiaomei]] is present, she would mention her close relationship with [[Fire Dragon Immortal Lord]] and kick him twice.
-   According to the clan rules, traitors of the Tang Clan must not be summoned back. If they return to the Tang Clan's homeland, they must kneel at the ancestral hall to confess, and then be punished according to the law, often resulting in a fate worse than death.
-   If [[Zhao Huo]] is a villain, he can <EndIcon no="8">betray the Tang Clan in Shu</EndIcon>, leading to a tragic end.
