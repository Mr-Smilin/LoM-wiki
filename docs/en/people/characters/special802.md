> "What are you doing here? Are you still following behind the little junior sister with that lecherous look on your face?"

As a female disciple of the [[Tang Sect]], Xin Ru, although beautiful, is a peculiar person who can fall asleep anywhere from her bed to the doorstep. Her terrible sleeping posture shocks the world, and she even uses her grappling skills to capture her senior sisters to use as pillows.

<br>

She once had a secret crush on [[Tang Buyi|Senior Brother]], but one day, when [[Tang Buyi|Senior Brother]] ran away quickly, she and several other junior disciples were ambushed on the way, narrowly avoiding a major incident. The [[Nan Gong Family]] and the Zhong Family joined forces to rescue them, which made her give up her feelings and marry into the Zhong Family, changing her surname to Xin.

<br>

Unfortunately, her husband turned out to be a bully and a coward, just a lackey in the [[Beggars' Sect]], unable to even leave the sect without the help of the [[Nan Gong Family]].

<br>

During the Nan Gong family banquet, she supported her husband's family by managing the food and beverages in Anji Fang, providing shelter for widows, orphans, and the disabled.

## Notes

-   She is known for her beautiful character design and the attributes of a senior sister and a married woman, unexpectedly gaining popularity among players(?).
-   Her mother-in-law is the younger sister of the head of the Nan Gong family, making her husband's family related to the [[Nan Gong Family]].
-   She shares the same birthday as [[Xiahou Lan]]. It is said that a fortune teller predicted the birth of an unparalleled beauty on that day, so Xin Ru's mother made a great effort to give birth to her. This likely occurred around November.[^1]
