<br><br>

Acting leader of the Soul Stealing Sect in the Kongtong Sect.
<br><br>
Initially captivated by the beauty of Xiahou Lan, he seized the opportunity to ascend the mountain after destroying the Xueshan Sect, changed her name, and forced her to become a direct disciple. Unexpectedly, Xiahou Lan later achieved great martial arts skills and refused to leave, monopolizing the position of direct disciple. The leader of the Soul Stealing Sect wanted to use force to make her step down, but ended up having his arms twisted and his head stepped on, causing him to lose face in front of the elders of the Kongtong Sect and retreat into seclusion for cultivation.

A member of the Qian Deng Tower, monitoring the actions of Yu Xiaomei.
