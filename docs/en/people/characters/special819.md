Prince Yi of the Jin Dynasty, the reigning emperor of the Jin Dynasty.
<br><br>
In his youth, he was diligent and talented, standing out among others. He sought to establish friendly relations with the Song Dynasty, which displeased Emperor Zhangzong Wan Yan Yongji. As a result, Wan Yan Xun was repeatedly demoted and imprisoned, leading to his father being stripped of his title and rank, and he himself faced ostracism and assassination attempts by court officials. Deeply impressed, Long Yuan intervened and saved him, forming a close bond and brotherly relationship despite their different backgrounds. After eight rounds of wine, they became sworn brothers, pledging to live and die together.
<br><br>
During the [[Battle of Jilejiao|Battle of Jilejiao]], Wan Yan Xun promised to lead troops to aid, but instead chose to sit back and reap the benefits. Long Yuan, recalling their past friendship, could not bring himself to seek retribution, and chose to disappear and live in seclusion after cutting off his own arm. Upon hearing this, Prince Yi was overcome with grief and sorrow. He sent letters and gifts to the Jinxiang Palace every year, intending to appoint Long Yuan's daughter, [[Long Xiang]], as a princess of the Jin Dynasty.

## Notes

-   Historically known as Emperor Xuanzong of Jin, the eighth emperor of the Jin Dynasty. [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Xuanzong_of_Jin)
-   The initial version included a plot where [[Long Xiang]] goes to the Jin Dynasty and meets Wan Yan Xun in the army. The current version (v1.0.3200) is locked and cannot be viewed normally.
-   Due to [[Long Xiang]], upon hearing that the Jinxiang Palace was attacked at Fengyushan, she was enraged and wanted to immediately launch an attack on the Song Dynasty.
