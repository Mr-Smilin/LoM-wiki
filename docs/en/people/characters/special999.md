## Biography

  <Tab title="Biography One">
	Despite his young age, he possesses extraordinary martial arts skills. Claiming to be from the Solitary Cloud Sect, a small sect unknown to anyone, he is full of admiration for the martial world. Carrying his precious sword, he travels around, meddling in affairs, standing up for justice, humble and righteous in his dealings, with excellent interpersonal relationships, making friends with various sects.<br><br>
	Since he started his journey, many women have fallen for him, but the ones he cares about are not easy to deal with, leading to many setbacks.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Two">
	Originally more arrogant and rebellious, with a hint of arrogance, he believed his swordsmanship had reached perfection, unmatched in the world. Full of ambition and ready to make a name for himself, he was summoned by his clan sister to the Xianghua Forest in Nanyang, where he was imprisoned in a strange formation for three months. He called for help every day, but no response came, the ground was unyielding, trees he cut grew back, and he couldn't escape the Five-Finger Mountain of the Xianghua Fairy.<br><br>
	After being released, he lost weight and became humble and kind, realizing the danger posed by the person he couldn't touch.
	Also, he was ordered not to seduce Wei Ju, which was very unfair.

## Notes

-   Introduction by Bird Bear on Facebook, [Link](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=340029291883786&set=pcb.340029328550449)
-   Originally thought wandering was cool, but living as a vagabond in the wilderness is not cool at all. Even in an inn, one cannot relax completely to avoid being attacked. Over time, the eye makeup became heavier.
-   Dislikes fancy clothing, loves cleanliness, doesn't want to be too sloppy, so he ends up wearing a clean striped robe.
-   Wan Li Peng Cheng calls Rui Sheng "Little Rui," unsure of their relationship.
-   Rejected by girls about 3-4 times. [^2]
-   ~~Possibly has a sister complex~~, often challenges difficult targets, first his clan sister [[Rui Xing]], then [[Hua Zhong Xian]], and later [[Xia Hou Lan]], who slapped him.
-   If the Tang Sect did not take in the Ye siblings, [[Liang You Shi]] would disappear from Rui Sheng's harem group.
-   If [[Tang Mo Ling|Junior Sister]] did not form a bond with [[Zhao Huo]], she would become one of Rui Sheng's harem.
-   There is another wife, Fang Du Ruo, who has not appeared in the harem yet (v3206). [^1]
-   <MarkdownWrapper>||According to data mining, there is a Sheng Huo duo line where they become good friends, v3206 has not been released yet||</MarkdownWrapper>
-   <MarkdownWrapper>||In the initial version, Sheng Huo fought Zhao Huo to a draw, but due to player dissatisfaction with the outcome, this ending has been deleted||</MarkdownWrapper>
