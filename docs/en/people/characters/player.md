> "I am truly hideous, why does heaven hate me so much?"

The protagonist of this story, the last non-family disciple of the Tang Sect.
<br><br>
Unattractive and extremely ugly. Walking on the street, he either scares people or gets pointed at and called a monster, never having a good day.
<br><br>
He refuses to leave the Tang Sect, not allowed to enter the inner sect for many years, only able to continue doing chores and being ordered around by others.
<br><br>
He likes [[Tang Moling|Junior Sister]], a glance from afar can satisfy him for a day.

## Childhood

Born in a rural farming family in Mianyang, even his own parents found him ugly. People in the countryside feared that children would be envious by ghosts and gods, so they gave them derogatory names, either "Cat Egg" or "Dog Leftover", Zhao Huo's siblings were no exception, but only he was called Zhao Huo.
<br><br>
Since childhood, he had a dream of becoming a great hero, but his appearance was too sorry, playing heroes with the village children could only end up being a tree. One year when the fields had a poor harvest, the family needed to cut back on meals, fearing being abandoned, he preemptively said he wanted to go to the Tang Sect to learn martial arts.
<br><br>
His father only prepared four eggs as a gift for entering the sect, walking barefoot from Mianyang to the Tang Sect, he was hungry and dizzy, and ate one egg. Over the years, he occasionally regretted, if he had endured not eating that egg, perhaps the sect leader wouldn't have looked down on him so much, and he would have been accepted into the inner sect earlier.
<br><br>
Little did he know, his father had been secretly protecting him all along. On the night he arrived at the Tang Sect, holding two chickens, he kowtowed to [[Tang Zhongling|Sect Leader]], saying he had not fulfilled his duty as a father, and couldn't bear to part with Zhao Huo until he left home. Not seeking fame and fortune, just wanting to return home in peace, he made the sect leader swear that the Tang Sect would never accept Zhao Huo as a disciple, but would teach him martial arts.

## Years in the Tang Sect

From the heyday to decline of the Tang Sect, having stayed for over a decade, all non-family disciples had left except him, still unable to enter the inner sect. Originally living in the outer stronghold of the Tang Sect closest to the latrine, due to the severe shrinkage of the sect, he was able to move into the main courtyard after selling the outer stronghold. Being the only non-family disciple and considering his appearance, he was often ordered around by other disciples. Cleaning, cooking, chopping wood, and various other tasks, he looked like a servant.
<br><br>
At the request of [[Tang Lu|Senior Sister]], he took care of [[Tang Moling|Junior Sister]] from childhood to adulthood, always the first to find her when she got lost. Their relationship was not particularly close, but it transcended the relationship between senior and junior siblings, which often made other disciples jealous. However, in a way, he brought it upon himself, as he would often hide outside the window to "protect" her.
<br><br>
If it weren't for being a non-family disciple, he might have been equivalent to the fifth senior brother in terms of seniority. He claimed he stayed in the Tang Sect because of Junior Sister, but with his appearance, he probably had nowhere else to go after being kicked out of his family. In fact, his efforts and perseverance were seen by the sect leader and senior brothers, although they couldn't directly help him due to his status, they still gave him some benefits in private.
<br><br>
He memorized the entire "Forgotten Forms" section of the Manual of Hidden Weapons, but due to the sect rules prohibiting guidance for non-family disciples, his martial arts skills remained mediocre. It wasn't until [[Tang Buyi|Black-Clothed Man]] provided guidance that he had a breakthrough, practicing various martial arts techniques from different sects, blending them into a hodgepodge that gave him some fighting ability. His eclectic skills even impressed the leader of the Beggars' Sect, [[Wang Erzhuang]].<br><br>
As the storm approached the Tang Sect, the outcome will vary based on your choices.

## Daily Routine

The schedule varies depending on the circumstances, if there's no firewood, he goes to chop wood, if the floor is dirty, he cleans it. As a non-family disciple, he must be thorough in all tasks.

<br>

Here is the daily routine of the diligent Zhao Huo:[^2]

-   Prepare breakfast in the early morning (around 4 AM)
-   Heat water for washing for the sect leader
-   Attend morning class if there's time
-   Rest after morning class, Zhao Huo cleans and washes dishes
-   Official work for the day part 1 (chopping wood, bookkeeping, shopping, pickling food, etc.)
-   Prepare lunch
-   Rest for lunch, Zhao Huo cleans and washes dishes
-   Official work for the day part 2
-   Prepare dinner
-   Zhao Huo cleans and washes dishes
-   Take a bath
-   Assist the third senior brother in organizing documents in the scripture hall
-   Tuck Junior Sister into bed
-   Night watch, stand guard in the main courtyard for 1 hour
-   Return to his room to sleep (around 12 AM)

## Age

-   Zhao Huo's birthday is not set, he himself is unsure of his age, even his parents don't know when he was born, wishing he could forget he ever existed
-   Zhao Huo can't remember how old he was when he joined the Tang Sect, he once said he was eleven or twelve when arguing with [[Tang Sheng|Third Senior Brother]], but told [[Tang Zhongling|Sect Leader]] he was around seven or eight
-   The sect leader mentioned that Zhao Huo came after [[Tang Moling|Junior Sister]] was born, so in the first year he should be around 22 years old (15+7)
-   During the Mount Kunlun sect study season, the legendary text by [[Xiahou Lan]] states, "Although Xiahou Lan and you are considered master and disciple, after all, you are only a few years older than him," indicating that Zhao Huo is ≤25 years old in the second year
-   Excluding the claim of joining the sect at eleven or twelve, based on the above deductions, Zhao Huo should be between 22-24 years old in the first year

## Mountain Song

Zhao Huo's mountain song, also known as the Junior Sister's Song, is a song he sang under the window when [[Tang Moling|Junior Sister]] was young, and she loved to hear it. However, Zhao Huo's voice was off-key, so to others, it sounded like wailing ghosts, leading them to believe it was a sonic technique.
<br><br>
It is said that Xiong once sang a song, but it was forced to be deleted by Niao for world peace, which is a great pity.

> "Little sister walks on the shore~ Big brother swims in the water~<br>
> I'm a mischievous little tadpole~ Taking you on an outing~<br>
> Look, there are cows by the river~ Cows twisting and turning~<br>
> Look under the tree, there's a dog~ Dog wagging its tail~<br>
> Oh my little junior sister~ Why are you sad for so long~<br>
> How can big brother bear to see you~ Shed tears freely~<br>
> Cry again and I'll~ Take you as my wife~

-   After years of doing chores, Zhao Huo is actually very capable and can get along anywhere, but only if he doesn't care about the martial world.
-   Zhao Huo's face is actually perfect for telling jokes.
-   According to [[Tang Buyi|Senior Brother]], Zhao Huo's mouth is even more despicable than his face.
-   According to [[Rui Xing]], Zhao Huo seems to have some connection with the royal family.
-   Referred to as "Wulin Scum" Juba by Niao Xiong at "Digital Taipei2021 Online Exhibition": [Video Link](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?mibextid=WC7FNe&v=1233034187106961&rdid=8LJ4hVfrxRlPIdcJ)

-   His zodiac sign is Sagittarius. ~~Burn your cosmos~~

-   If not studying abroad, [[Tang Zhongling|Sect Leader]] will pass down a small sword to the Tang Sect. ~~This sword often appears in the writings of the Longyang Study Room~~
-   The painting by Guai Hua Tu was thought to possibly be the work of Du Fu by [[Geng Yang Study Room]], purchased for further research.
-   Because older non-family disciples are advised to leave the Tang Sect, Zhao Huo shaves regularly to avoid looking old.[^1]
-   Although he sometimes goes crazy with pepper when cooking, he doesn't particularly like pepper.[^1]
-   The "Mega" in Mega Zhao Huo is a nod to Mega Man in English, "MEGA MAN".
-   The parrot of Mega Zhao Huo is a tribute to the Xuan-Yuan Sword mechanism. The parrot was named Zhao Huo from a young age, and it harbors a grudge against humans because when everyone bullied Zhao Huo, they called it out by name, leading the parrot to believe everyone was targeting it, hence holding a grudge. [^4]
-   The power source of Mega Zhao Huo is a spring, magnetism, and GATE wire. [^1]
-   The entire Zhao Huo family are ordinary commoners with unremarkable appearances, except for him, who has a particularly refined appearance. [^3]
-   According to the legendary text, Zhao Huo's later martial arts realm is described as, "Regarding internal strength and physique, he may not even reach a second or third-rate level, but his moves are varied and unpredictable, nearing the realm of having no fixed moves. He deeply understands the principles of offense, defense, advance, and retreat, each move and style holds great mystery, encompassing martial arts from all over the world with unexpected moves."
