# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

[[Tang Clan]] Master, younger sister of [[Tang Zhongling]], and wife.
<br><br>
Twenty years ago, during the chaos caused by the Jilejiao in the martial arts world, she was poisoned by the 'Corpse Heart Pill' and controlled by others, suspected to have given birth to [[Tang Zheng]] during this period. Later, Tang Zhongling saved her, and despite the grave mistake, he still promised to be with her for life.
<br><br>
After a few years of marriage, they were blessed with [[Tang Moling]], but she remained quietly unhappy. After entrusting Tang Moling to [[Zhao Huo]], she jumped off a cliff. Tang Moling has not stopped missing her mother for ten years, folding paper cranes by the window every night, filled with thoughts of her mother.
<br><br>
She once gave [[Tang Buyi]] a miraculous pill and a glass flower, which were actually Tang Clan's hidden weapon, the "Invisible Arrow".

## Notes

- If she brings [[Tang Moling|Little Junior Sister]] to the martial arts conference and faces off against [[Shangguan Jun]], he will mistake Little Junior Sister for Master.
- ~~From this, it can be seen that the Lolita complex of the Tang Clan can be traced back to the previous generation~~
- When [[Tang Zhongling|Old Devil Tang]] was young, he once chased and killed a frivolous master's younger son for a thousand miles, causing a demon in his heart when he reached the Nansong Mountain Temple.
