> "For a whole day?" "For a lifetime."

Junior Sister of the Tang Sect, the first female protagonist in the story, and the beloved only daughter of the current sect master.
<br><br>
Junior Sister is a quiet and shy girl, with a hobby of origami.
<br><br>
At the beginning of the story, [[Zhao Huo]] fell in love with her, which made him unwilling to leave the Tang Sect.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, love does not always have a happy ending. Surrounded by rivals, her romantic journey can only be described as tumultuous, with bloodshed and tears flowing like rivers.

## Biography

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Biography One">
	The beloved only daughter of the Tang Sect's sect master.<br><br>
	Worried about her delicate health, the sect master secluded himself for three years, pondering over a unique martial art, and created the "Silent Force of Heaven and Earth" specifically for his daughter.<br><br>
	Practitioners must wear seven bells on their body, training until they can move swiftly and throw hidden weapons without making a sound, in order to achieve great success.<br>
	Influenced by this martial art, she became indifferent, rarely showing emotions, not fond of speaking, and seldom smiling.<br><br>
	Her hobby is origami.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Two">
	Although she continued her training, she did not enjoy it. She used to cry frequently at the beginning.<br><br>
	Training was tough, and she feared being scolded by her father,<br>
	Whenever she felt upset, she would seek comfort in her mother's embrace, or seek refuge with her elder martial brother or second martial brother.<br>
	After her mother's passing, she stopped running away.<br><br>
	Unknowingly, she had completed a set of martial arts techniques without breaking a sweat, and even forgot how to shed a tear.<br><br>
	She locked her emotions deep inside, and no one could see her true self.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Three">
	Before the sect master's wife passed away, she lied to her daughter:<br>
	"I will go into seclusion in the secluded valley of the Tang Sect for ten years. If you miss me, fold a paper crane and send it to the bottom of the valley. When I see it, I will know that you are thinking of your mother."<br><br>
	For the past ten years, Junior Sister never missed a day,<br>
	Every night, she would fold paper cranes by the window, filled with thoughts of her mother.<br><br>

	Moling became very attentive to you.<br>
	She always wanted to be close to you, quietly staying by your side.<br><br>
	In her innocent eyes, she couldn't see physical beauty, only longing for a sense of security.<br>
	She wasn't very interested in the affairs of the martial world, couldn't even recognize the way down the mountain, but she was very clear that she admired you.<br><br>
	The expressionless girl blossomed like a flower, and the ordinary days spent with you were incomparable every day.

## Bells

In order to practice the Silent Force of Heaven and Earth, she wears seven bell chains on her body, on her neck, arms, wrists, and legs (though they often slip down to her ankles). The seven bell chains act as restraints, sealing her joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, hatred, and desires, causing her heart to beat slowly and her body temperature to be low. If left alone, she would likely live a long life. When the bells ring, it's as if her soul is screaming at the top of its lungs.
<br><br>
[[Tang Zhongling|The Sect Master]] was not good at parenting, [[Tang Buyi|Elder Martial Brother]] was always getting into trouble, while [[Tang Zheng|Second Martial Brother]] was well-behaved and rarely got scolded. For the sake of training, it was no surprise that Junior Sister also faced punishment when the bells rang. She would be disciplined with a cane. Starting from a young age, even the most lively child would turn into a lifeless fish. Junior Sister's silence was three parts innate and seven parts acquired.
<br><br>
Part of the reason for wearing the bell chains was to prevent her from getting lost due to her poor sense of direction.

## Token of Fate

## Notes

-   Introduction by Bird Bear FB: [Link](https://www.facebook.com/obbstudio/photos/pb.100076301525150.-2207520000/119387850459402/?type=3)
-   Birthday is on 3/24.
-   She was born on a day when the Tang Sect was at war with another sect. [^6]
-   The first female protagonist designed by Xiong, originally intended to be the only romanceable character, and also Xiong's favorite character.
-   Loves eating grilled fish, a lifelong love for grilled fish!
-   When she sees someone feeling down, she will pat them on the back with her small hands to cheer them up. She firmly believes that her small hands possess a mysterious power to heal people's hearts, which works wonders on her father, elder martial brother, and second martial brother. If it doesn't work on you, try patting a few more times.
-   Naturally inclined towards small animals, combined with the poverty of the Tang Sect, she missed the golden growth period and is unlikely to grow taller.
-   Has no concept of being full, doesn't often eat sweet things, but once she has the chance, she will keep stuffing her mouth until she falls asleep. If left unchecked, she will inevitably become three times larger. [^1]
-   In the first year, when [[Zhao Huo]] fainted, [[Tang Sheng|Third Martial Brother]] mentioned that Junior Sister was already in her prime, indicating she was around fifteen years old.
-   Referred to as a little lamb by [[Xia Lingxi]], and after a bloody incident, was called the "Rampaging Little Lamb" by [[Tang Weiyuan|Fourth Martial Brother]].
-   Is sensitive to cold. [^3]
-   Seems to be bad at drawing, as teased by [[Liu Ya]] to have someone carve her drawings into ancient relics.
-   Terrible at singing. Junior Sister is shy and rarely sings in front of strangers. She is afraid of being mocked, so only [[Zhao Huo]] gets to hear her sing. [^4][^5]
-   Has a youthful appearance that doesn't reveal her age. [^6]
-   Junior Sister is actually more difficult to handle than everyone imagines. She needs to be doted on by more than half of her life before gradually opening up. [^7]
-   When she first met [[Shangguan Ying]], she admired her beauty and despaired over her own chances of growing taller. During her time in the Tang Sect, [[Shangguan Ying]] doted on Junior Sister excessively. When [[Nan Gongshen]] proposed, he would question why she didn't choose [[Shangguan Ying]] and wanted to marry him instead, disagreeing with [[Nan Gongshen]]'s mistreatment of his fiancee.

### Zhao Huo

-   ~~Watch your own back! Watch your own back... Watch your own back~~
-   Entrusted to care for Junior Sister by [[Tang Lu|Mother]].
-   Possibly due to growing up together, she doesn't find [[Zhao Huo]] unattractive. ~~Junior Sister is actually crazy!~~
-   Enjoys the mountain songs sung by [[Zhao Huo]].
-   Every night, [[Zhao Huo]] goes to Junior Sister's window, tells her stories, and lulls her to sleep.
-   Junior Sister knew early on that it was [[Zhao Huo]] outside her window, but she never revealed it without being asked.

### Elder Martial Brother

-   The Tang Sect once had [[Tang Buyi|Elder Martial Brother]] leading a group of troublemakers, who enjoyed scaring Junior Sister for fun, but was later dealt with by [[Tang Zheng|Second Martial Brother]].
-   Misdeeds of [[Tang Buyi|Elder Martial Brother]]:
    -   Put her on a raft while she was napping, and let it drift downstream, only waking up when the raft broke apart and she fell into the water.
    -   Carried her on his shoulders to run up the mountain path for lightness training until she was so dizzy she vomited.
    -   Suddenly closed the door on her as she was about to enter her room, then laughed mockingly.
    -   Carried her down the mountain to learn the way, but walked so fast that she got lost and cried helplessly.
    -   Took her to see the lanterns on the street, but was chatting and laughing with a stranger, causing her great distress.
    -   Promised to buy colored paper but forgot, and even tore up the paper crane she had folded as a substitute.

### Martial Arts

-   Despite appearing unalert, if she doesn't move at all from dawn, she will notice any movement with a 99% success rate.
-   Rarely ventures into the martial world, and even less frequently spars with others. Despite her lack of experience in combat, her single-minded focus over the years has allowed her to grasp the secrets of the Tang Sect's martial arts, giving her a high level of insight.
-   In the western martial arts storyline, when [[Zhao Huo]] faced off against [[Tan Badao]], Junior Sister intervened, defeating Badao in three moves without him being able to fight back. Badao's last words were, "The strongest in the Tang Sect, isn't it [[Tang Buyi]]..."
-   During a sparring session with [[Tang Buyi|Elder Martial Brother]] in the training grounds, Junior Sister participated and defeated him.
-   [[Tang Buyi|Elder Martial Brother]] praised her lightness skill as being in the top five in the world, while he wasn't confident enough to rank in the top ten. It is said that when she fully utilizes the "Silent Force of Heaven and Earth," she is like three people in one.

### Conclusion

-   If there is no bond, she will marry [[Ruisheng]], and if [[Ruisheng]] dies in the western martial arts storyline, she will return to the Tang Sect.
-   If there is a bond, after the events in the western martial arts storyline, she will settle down with [[Zhao Huo]] in the Tang Sect. [^2]

    > All I can say is, if Junior Sister lived in modern times, she would be a ruthless killer in the Moba gaming world, specializing in high-damage characters who don't care about their lives, always getting kills. No matter how others taunt her, she would only reply with "= =" or "Oh." <br><br>
    > After satisfying her bloodlust by killing a bunch of people, she would close the game contentedly and continue to be addicted to her phone. <br><br>
    > Her strength comes from her hand speed, an unusually cold and pure killing intent, and a bag of potato chips by her side.
