## Biography

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Biography One">
	Lazy-eyed, passive, and decadent, with a penchant for fishing.<br><br>
	He claims not to like drinking, but often gets drunk.<br><br>
	Wang Er Zhuang was the key to the Beggar Gang's transformation from black to white. Since leading the gang, he vigorously promoted chivalry, allowing young gang disciples to see hope again and believe that even in the mud, they can still rise above it. <br><br>
	As long as one holds chivalry in their heart, even in tattered clothes, they can still be proud. Aren't those clean officials the epitome of integrity? <br><br>
	The rise of the new generation swept away the old habits of the Beggar Gang. Their actions were all open and above board, no longer engaging in petty thefts, wishing they could act chivalrously.

  <Tab title="Biography Two">
	Originally named Wang Chunlin, with generations of military officers in his ancestry, Wang Chunlin also received a title as Dingyuan Lang.<br><br>
	But he was gentle and refined, preferring poetry and chess over martial arts. When it came to military strategy, he studied it, but the thought of going to the battlefield to defend his country made him tremble.<br><br>
	It wasn't until he met Nangong Yuan and encountered Su Yingxiang that he reluctantly entered the martial world in order to win the favor of the beauty.<br><br>
	He excelled in everything compared to Nangong Yuan, but in Su Yingxiang's eyes, she only favored Nangong Yuan. Wang Chunlin was heartbroken, crying and despondent, even running to Donglin Temple in tears, wanting to become a monk, which led to a life-changing opportunity.<br><br>
	He bowed under the guidance of Master Chunmian, wanting to learn Buddhism, but Master Chunmian insisted on forcing him to practice martial arts. It wasn't until much later that Wang Chunlin learned that his master was the legendary Red Pong Wang, the martial king of the Eastern Thirteen Provinces.
