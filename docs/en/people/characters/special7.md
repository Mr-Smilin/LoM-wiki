  <Tab title="Biography One">
	When Shi Gong Yuan was young, he joined the military and encountered the lowly soldiers under the famous general Bi Zaiyu. Later, he deserted the army and became a bandit in Maoshi Mountain, Maozhou.<br><br>
	Shi Gong Yuan had no great ambitions, living day by day, drinking and feasting with his gang, living a reckless life, practicing martial arts skillfully, and becoming a strong warrior.<br>
	He even boldly kidnapped the newly appointed magistrate on foot and forcibly married the magistrate's daughter as his wife.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Two">
	After the magistrate's daughter became his wife, Shi Gong Yuan's wild life came to an end.<br><br>
	No one knew that the delicate daughter of the magistrate was actually a fierce woman who could dominate this burly man, turning the bandit leader into a submissive husband.<br><br>
	Under his wife's gentle advice, he carried a willow branch to the yamen to plead guilty, expecting severe punishment, but to his surprise, his young wife interceded and spared him.<br><br>
	The magistrate welcomed him into the family, pardoned his past crimes, and finally accepted him as a son-in-law.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Three">
	Under the assistance of his wise wife, he gathered his former bandits and founded Fei Shi Gang.<br>
	Specializing in renting out labor and handling manual labor, they engaged in outsourcing business.<br><br>
	Regardless of the character of the recruits, they had to abide by the gang rules and not disturb the people. Shi Gong Yuan also reformed himself, becoming a righteous and kind-hearted man.<br><br>
	Fei Shi Gang rose rapidly, and within twenty years, they had hundreds of gang members, able to rival the three major gangs in the region.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Four">
	Everything started with misunderstandings, but the mistakes were too big for anyone to back down.<br><br>
	Until you intervened, turning swords into gifts, reconciling past conflicts, making everything seem like a passing cloud.<br><br>
	Although Shi Gong Yuan has now retired and withdrawn from the world with his beloved wife, he still remembers the kindness of the Tang Clan deep in his heart.<br><br>
	Swearing in secret, if the Tang Clan ever faces trouble, he cannot stand idly by.

## Notes

-   His martial arts skills come from various schools, mastering both the Songshan [[Golden Bell Armor|Iron Cloth Shirt]] and the Kongtong [[Iron Arm Divine Fist]], with the latter being more famous.
-   Although he can tense his muscles to resist pressure point attacks, he is vulnerable to distractions and cannot defend against internal attacks due to lack of internal energy cultivation.
-   When he challenged [[Rui Sheng]] in the western martial arts line, he was defeated instantly, and later, [[Yin Zhiping]] mentioned that he was a straightforward and generous person, regretting his death and secretly letting him go.
-   He disliked the delicate locust dish made by [[Zhao Huo]] after two days and nights of effort, claiming he was rough and afraid he would crush it as soon as he touched it.
-   The biography mentions him becoming a bandit in Maoshi Mountain in Maozhou, but during a conversation with [[Zhao Huo]] and [[Tang Buyi|Senior Brother Tang]], it is said to be Tengyun Mountain in Tanzhou.
