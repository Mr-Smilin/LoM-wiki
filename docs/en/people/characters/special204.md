<br><br>

The head of the Kongtong Sect Feitian, known for his unique celestial fire technique.
<br><br>
He has a senior disciple, [[Danxia Zi]], who sees him as a threat to his position and tricks him into going to the Songjin battlefield to die. He also has a direct female disciple, [[Yu Xiaomei]], and supports [[Jin Wu Shang Ren]], attempting to gain more power in the sect's internal struggles.
<br><br>
Over twenty years ago, he participated in the Qingcheng Daoist Conference, where his misinterpretation of the Dao led to Zhao Kui's Dao heart sinking, eventually falling into the hellish Dao method and becoming the King of Hell. This led to a grudge with [[Zou Bo]].

## Notes

-   The Immortal Lord is very petty, not tolerating any competition. Don't boast too much at the Feitian Sect. <BadendIcon :no="15">Book of Life and Death No.15</BadendIcon>
-   Treats [[Jin Wu Shang Ren]] as an equal
-   Once flattered Shangguan Sun, claiming to be the reincarnation of the East Sea Dragon King
