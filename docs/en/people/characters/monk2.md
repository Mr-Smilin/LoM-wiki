> "When the world is in trouble, one must enter society. The Buddha's teachings do not need to be cultivated and verified; cultivation and verification lie within people."

A highly respected monk from the Songshan Sect, who has been reclusive for a long time and never involved in the martial world.
<br><br>
He appeared at the martial arts conference, claiming to be old and lacking virtue, unable to take on the role of the leader of the martial arts world, and excused himself in advance. He will soon retire to the mountains, unwilling to be tainted by worldly affairs.

## Monk Without Thoughts

If you walk through the western martial arts world and return with the Flying Heroes, there will be a conversation between an old monk and [[Shen Tu Long]]. The standing portrait of the old monk and Jue Hui are the same, possibly the same person.
<br><br>
[[Tang Buyi]] mentioned that the old monk was the first generation of the Thousand-Faced Demon, Monk Without Thoughts, who attacked alongside [[Tang Zheng]], resulting in the death of the old monk.

## Notes

-   The awakened master who received the [[Nayuta Finger]] also uses the same standing portrait.
