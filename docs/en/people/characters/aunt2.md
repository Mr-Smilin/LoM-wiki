> "Just a disciple from an outside clan, not recognizing her own identity, dared to lay a hand on my adopted son?"

Master Aunt of the Tang Clan.
<br><br>
Before being taken over by [[Tang Sheng|Third Senior Brother]], she was in charge of the accounts, working hard and sacrificing her youth for the Tang Clan. She only got married when she was approaching forty, causing everyone in the Tang Clan to feel indebted to her. Even though she married out of the Tang Clan, she would occasionally return to show her authority, and due to her seniority, the disciples did not dare to defy her.
<br><br>
She views [[Zhao Huo]] as a lowly servant, still bearing the Zhao surname after so many years, unable to stand seeing him doing well.
<br><br>
[[Tang Zhongling|Head]] personally promised her that as long as it did not go against morals or the clan's principles, the Tang Clan would help her accomplish any difficult task. However, little did they know, [[Chao He]] managed to deceive her into becoming his adoptive mother, planting the seeds of trouble for the Tang Clan.
