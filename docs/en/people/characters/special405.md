A Daoist cultivator of the Qingcheng Sect, despite his young age, he holds a high position as a disciple of the former sect leader of Qingcheng.
<br><br>
He has a handsome appearance, gentle and refined demeanor. When not cultivating, he often wanders in the mountains, paying little attention to worldly affairs. He rarely disputes with others, only displaying his martial arts skills during the monthly assessments within the Qingcheng Sect. Despite this, his reputation quietly spreads.
<br><br>
Often, female admirers pretend to be troubled by demons to seek his help due to his handsome appearance. They claim to be plagued by evil spirits and request his intervention at Qingcheng. Shen Tulong, knowing it to be false, never exposes the deception to preserve everyone's feelings.
<br><br>
While Qingcheng Daoists consider it their duty to eliminate demons and evil spirits, Shen Tulong fundamentally does not believe in the existence of such creatures. The only time his belief wavered was when he encountered [[Zhao Huo]], and he was extremely frightened at that time.

-   Actually the reincarnation of the Jile Teachings leader [[Li Renyou]] who used the "Nine Reincarnation Great Law" to take over a new body and be reborn
-   The compound surname is Shen Tu, with the given name Long
-   He always has a bird perched on his hand, ~~leading to speculation among players that he is actually a bird spirit~~
