> "You so-called righteous heroes, always talking about good and evil, not realizing your own wickedness! The King of Hell Dao, Zhao Kui, is here! Demons and monsters, dare to challenge~!"

The King of Hell Dao in the Mud Sect, elusive, carrying out private executions everywhere, causing trouble for both sides of the law. He also performs exorcisms, with a chilling aura, closely associated with the notorious reputation of the Mud Sect.
<br><br>
Originally a junior disciple of the Qingcheng Sect under [[Zou Bo]], he was misunderstood by the Fire Dragon Immortal during the Qingcheng Dao Conference, leading to his moral decline. Following the battle against the Joyful Sect, he was defeated by the demonic power of the Joyful Sect's Left Guardian, becoming increasingly violent, eventually falling into the role of the King of Hell Dao.
<br><br>
His renowned skill is the "Heavenly Master Swordsmanship".

## Notes

-   If Zhao Huo kills Jin Wu Shang Ren during the martial arts competition, everyone will say that even the Nine Lives Leopard cannot escape death in the end, it must be the envoy of the King of Hell, also surnamed Zhao, possibly related to the King of Hell Dao, tarnishing the reputation of the Tang Sect.
