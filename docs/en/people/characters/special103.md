## Notes

-   Due to the controversial nature of his character development and portrayal, every time there is a discussion thread about him, it leads to arguments and off-topic comments, eventually earning him the title of "Jie Chuan Xia".
-   He was called Ah Qian before returning to the Nan Gong family to acknowledge his relatives, showing a submissive attitude towards the eldest young master[^1].
-   At the age of five or six, brought into the family by his mother, shortly after acknowledging his ancestry, his mother passed away.
-   He was not allowed to wear shoulder armor, and [[Nan Gong Yuan]] did not protect him, even the food he ate was cold. The martial arts passed down in the family were taught by the old servants at home.
-   The Jiangling incident involved [[Wang Erzhuang|Master Wang]] performing marrow cleansing for him, but he was not very appreciative.
-   Before the martial arts competition, he had three encounters: the old monk in the [[Apricot Blossom Forest]] taught him the method of concentrating qi and spirit, [[Yuan Chengfeng|Great Ape Monkey]] trained his muscles and bones, and [[Shangguan Jun|Dragon King of the Eastern Sea]] taught him swordsmanship.
