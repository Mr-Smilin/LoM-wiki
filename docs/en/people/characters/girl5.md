## Notes

-   Introduction by Bird Bear FB: [Link](https://www.facebook.com/obbstudio/photos/pb.100076301525150.-2207520000/173139081750945/?type=3)
-   The most beautiful woman in the martial world, ~~a woman who can be your master, mother, and wife at the same time~~
-   ~~I want a wife who is also my master and seduces my ancestors!~~
-   A true native of Lanzhou.[^3]
-   Although she lives in the Soul Snatchers Forest, she only moved in the past year or two, finding the Soul Snatchers Sect too bothersome.
-   When living alone in the forest, she either hunts forest animals for food, grows her own vegetables outside the forest, or occasionally buys food in town.[^2]
-   After living in a treehouse in the forest for a long time, she had many mosquitoes but didn't use mosquito repellent or nets until reminded by [[Zhao Huo]]. She then spent four to five hours burning mosquitoes with candles in a fit of madness.
-   In her youth, she was gentle, compassionate, protective of the weak, and fought against injustice, preferring dialogue over violence.[^2]
-   Enjoys hot pot.[^2]
-   Has a generally good singing voice.[^4]
-   More afraid of dogs than wolves. If a wolf wants to eat her, she deserves it, but dogs are more troublesome, wagging their tails to please, making it hard to harm them. However, if she encounters an aggressive dog that bites people, she will not hesitate to kill both the dog and its irresponsible owner.
-   Shares a birthday with [[Xin Ru]], possibly around November. A fortune teller said that on that day, a peerless beauty would be born in Song Country.[^5]

### Age

-   Xiahou Lan: "At that time, I was in my prime... Shortly after returning from my travels to prove my innocence, I married [[Third Xiang|Third Senior Brother]]."
-   [[Jie Wu Chen]]: "She's already twenty-six or twenty-seven, a middle-aged woman." (Third-year matchmaking event)
-   ~~Due to Jie's lack of credibility~~, based on her own response and adding a seven-year agreement, she should be 23 in the third year of the game, estimated to be 24-25.

### Martial Arts

-   Among the Kongtong Sect, only the [[Fire Dragon Immortal Lord]] and [[Danxia Zi]] can match her.
-   When the Soul Snatchers sect leader tried to use force to make her relinquish her position as the legitimate female disciple, she twisted his arms, stepped on his head, and was too ashamed to face the elders of the Kongtong Sect, retreating to seclusion for cultivation.
-   She usually carries a special weapon made by the Iron Fist Sect, the Steel Bone Umbrella. Pulling the umbrella handle triggers hidden blades for both offense and defense, impervious to water and fire.
-   During her journey to the Snow Mountain, she used the Snow Mountain Sect's unique acupoint technique, "Glacier Acupoint Brushing," to immobilize [[Zhao Huo]].
-   When facing [[Shangguan Jun]], she used the Snow Mountain Sect's "Plum Tremble Twig" to try to shake off the Golden Back Dragon King Blade.

### Relationships

-   Traveled with [[Tang Bu Yi]], [[Jie Wu Chen]], and two others, defeating the Elysium Left Envoy together.
-   Heard that opening an umbrella indoors attracts ghosts, so she opened one to keep [[Hu Yan Ju]]'s soul from leaving, which is why she lives in the dark forest.
-   Had a prearranged marriage with [[Shangguan Ying]], but it was never fulfilled due to the destruction of the Snow Mountain Sect.
-   Considers [[Nan Gong Shen]] a fool, but respects [[Nan Gong Heng|Elder Nan Gong]] and [[Tang Zhong Ling]] greatly.
-   Once in trouble at the Changsha Yuhua Pavilion, she was rescued by [[Tang Bu Yi]].
-   Xiahou Lan used to tell stories to [[Yu Xiao Mei|Xiao Mei]] and [[Yu Zhu|Xiao Zhu]]. Once, when she brought them to the Soul Snatchers Forest, she told a ghost story that frightened [[Yu Zhu|Xiao Zhu]], causing her to break a tree in fear, which terrified Xiahou Lan at the time.
-   Refers to the Tangmen treehouse as the "Snow Mountain Sect Tangmen Branch."

### Fateful Connection

-   Rubbing her legs is a signal, time to take a bath!
-   After the Western Wulin ending, she will settle in the Snow Mountain with [[Zhao Huo]].[^1]
-   After marriage, she gives birth to a boy and a girl, both resembling their mother, and she spoils them excessively.
-   To educate her children, she once went out and caught [[Wei Ju]] to be their teacher.
-   Without a fateful connection, she will go to the Snow Mountain Sect ruins and duel with [[Third Xiang]] before taking her own life.

### Miscellaneous

-   Recommended to learn the [[Dragon Chant Technique]] when pursuing her, surprises await in the Western Wulin storyline.
-   Famous quote: "All living beings die, everything can be killed."
