## Notes

-   ~~Tang Sect Monkey Hero~~
-   Introduction by Bird Bear on FB: [Link](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=119387863792734&set=pcb.119387933792727)
-   Participated in robbing a judicial court with [[Tang Zhongling|Sect Leader]] and [[Tang Zheng|Fierce Hand Master]] before the age of ten
-   Assuming they were 7 to 9 years old at the time of the robbery, and [[Tang Weiyuan]] was found the following year on a snowy day, it can be inferred that his age is around 25 to 27
-   Approximately 172 cm tall[^7]
-   Enjoys pranks, the more he is teased, the happier he becomes, [[Zhao Huo]] calls him a lil' rascal
-   The lively atmosphere in Tang Sect is mostly due to Senior Brother, everyone emulates his lack of distinction between seniority, speaking without regard
-   Does not support shoulder armor
-   Despite the friendly relations between Tang Sect and the Nangong Family, he has masked himself more than once to secretly attack [[Nangong Shen]]
-   In his childhood, he destroyed a toy beloved by [[Nangong Shen]] because [[Nangong Shen]] kept flaunting it and poking him with it
-   In a competition, he once occupied a bandit stronghold, resisting the official soldiers led by [[Tang Zhongling|Sect Leader]] for ten days, then was severely punished by the Sect Leader and sent back to the mountain for reflection, known in the martial world as the "Mianyang Bo Incident"
-   Traveled with [[Xie Wuchen]], [[Xiahou Lan]], and two shepherd companions, intervening in injustices, practicing chivalry, from strangers to friends, defeating Jin Dynasty wrestlers, repelling Goryeo demon sect, reforming the Hainan faction, and ultimately joining forces to defeat the Elysium Left Envoy
-   Dreams of retiring from the martial world and performing crosstalk with [[Zhao Huo]]<EndIcon no="46"> on stage</EndIcon>
-   If he learns of [[Zhao Huo]]'s death, he will seek revenge, depending on the circumstances, the means may not necessarily involve killing[^3]
-   It is said that he is trying to completely erase the threshold for learning martial arts, so that future generations, everyone can learn martial arts for self-defense[^3]
-   Zodiac sign is the free-spirited Sagittarius
-   Sometimes sleeps in the kitchen, sometimes in a tree, sometimes in a brothel
-   Although it is not visible in the standing illustration, if he sparred with Senior Brother, you can see from the attack diagram that he has a jade pendant around his waist similar to [[Tang Zheng|Second Junior Brother]]
-   The jade pendant originally belonged to [[Tang Zhongling|Sect Leader]] and [[Tang Lu|Master's Wife]], the Sect Leader's was given to Senior Brother, and the Master's Wife's was in the hands of [[Tang Zheng|Second Junior Brother]], a token of affection, [source](https://www.plurk.com/p/3g9a4xb0oh)
-   Short on money? Go find bandits!
-   After taking money from bandits, Senior Brother always intentionally leaves them a way out, allowing them to recuperate before going back to rob them. In the later period, Shu region became a place of turmoil, and the green forest heroes avoided it like the plague[^2]
-   Shu region's twin talents, Flying Hero and Cloud Dragon. Flying Hero refers to Tang Buyi, while Cloud Dragon refers to [[Xie Wuchen]]. Currently, Xie Wuchen has won twenty-nine times, lost thirty times, and tied forty-seven times. However, the competition may not necessarily be martial arts; Senior Brother would challenge him to see who had a better alcohol tolerance, followed by who was more generous, to avoid paying for drinks[^4]
-   Favorite food is leaf bun
-   Once altered the secret manual of Tang Sect, instructing disciples to aim their hidden weapons specifically at people's coin purses
-   Once manipulated [[Zhao Huo]] in the Forgetful Chapter by guiding him as a mysterious figure
-   Unable to master the Flying Swallow Meteor Dart, he took a risky move to practice the "Nine Revolutions Reincarnation Great Law," fell into demonic ways, regressing in internal cultivation. Going all out easily led to unintended consequences, resulting in manslaughter and self-inflicted injuries[^1]
-   Currently, for him, the allure of a girl is only slightly higher than that of dumplings. If there are two dumplings, he will unhesitatingly choose the dumplings[^6]
-   Cooks whatever he feels like, throwing in whatever he catches into the pot. [[Tang Moling|Junior Sister]] didn't move after eating a spoonful of porridge, but her bell jingled. [[Tang Zheng|Second Junior Brother]] vomited after eating a steamed bun, frowning and saying the food was poisonous.
-   Hid monkey wine on the back mountain, in a recess on the cliff three zhang high, impervious to wind and rain.
-   Also treasured a bottle of fine grape wine, said to love this wine more than his own life, gave it to [[Shi Gongyuan|Leader of the Stone Gang]] when reconciling with the Flying Stone Gang at the point of no return.
-   Once had a secret crush on a junior sister, [[Tang Fang]] sister. When Senior Brother and [[Zhao Huo]] discussed this, Second Junior Brother's reaction was extreme, suddenly exploding in anger, frightening [[Tang Moling|Junior Sister]].
-   In his childhood, he and [[Tang Zheng|Second Junior Brother]] once took a senior sister's bustier and filled it with candies. When they returned with a full bag, instead of praise, they were severely punished. Since then, [[Tang Zheng|Second Junior Brother]]'s eyes became unusually sharp, seemingly harboring resentment towards him.
-   Grew up with [[Tang Zheng|Second Junior Brother]], their friendship lasting the longest. There was a time when they were very close, during the monthly exam, Second Junior Brother would let Senior Brother copy his answers, but Second Junior Brother's attitude became stern, marking the beginning of Senior Brother's escape from home to wander the martial world[^5]
