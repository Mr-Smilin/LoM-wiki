The head of the Nan Gong family, a centenarian, is highly respected in the martial arts world. When he hosts a birthday banquet, everyone must give him face.
<br><br>
At the banquet, he proposed an exchange of disciples among the various sects for study and apprenticeship.
<br><br>
Before the decisive battle at Jiangling, he received a secret letter from [[Rui Xing]] and went to meet, only to die of a broken heart.

## Notes

-   His nickname for [[Tang Buyi|Senior Brother]] was given when he was a bandit, as Nan Gong Patriarch changed his name to help clear his name.[^1]
