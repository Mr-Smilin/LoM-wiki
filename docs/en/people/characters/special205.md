## Notes

-   He was the only one who tried to stop the battle between the rival factions at the Mie Men Xian, but unfortunately, he couldn't change the course of events.
-   Due to his appearance, he was often mistaken for a villain, despite not having done anything wrong, leading to suspicions that he was the mastermind behind certain events.
-   He was once mistaken for Jile Zuo Shi and nearly killed by the young [[Tang Buyi|Flying Hero]], [[Jie Wuchen|Wind God]], and [[Xiahou Lan|Soul-stealing Orchid]]. (In the FB, it was written as Jile You Shi, but according to the v1.0.3202 update, it should be Jile Zuo Shi)
-   He felt an immediate kinship with [[Zhao Huo]], both being outcasts, and proclaimed themselves as the second-in-command of the Ugly Men Alliance, with you being the first.
-   He was the sixth leader of the Quanzhen Sect in history.
