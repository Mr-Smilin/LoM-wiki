# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Historically known as the husband of the Jin Dynasty (12th century - July 16, 1221), his real name was A Hai.
<br><br>
As the Governor of Xuanfu in Shandong, he established the "Yanglong Garden" to recruit and persuade martial artists from the Song Dynasty.
<br><br>
During the time when [[Tang Buyi]] was the Left Deputy Marshal of the Jin Dynasty, he was beheaded by him, and even used his head as a hidden weapon to kill a pursuing soldier.

## Notes

- The concept of the Yanglong Garden is inspired by a segment involving Long Xiang Lime Powder.
