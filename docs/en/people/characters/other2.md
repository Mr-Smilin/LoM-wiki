Realizing that he was no match for Third Xiang, he became obsessed with the belief that supreme martial arts were hidden within paintings and calligraphy. As the sect leader election approached, he devoted himself to studying art, neglecting food and sleep.

Upon discovering a secret meeting between Third Xiang and Huyan Ju, he impulsively attacked, but Huyan Ju sacrificed herself to save Xiahou Lan from Yan Luo Sheng's Judge's Pen. Third Xiang died in the confrontation, his intestines spilled out.
