> "An insignificant brat like you, why should I lose to you? I, Fang Zhen Tian, am the pride of heaven!"

A wandering swordsman from the Jingjiang Prefecture, belonging to no sect or school, just like [[Qi Ren]], arrogant and reckless. His fighting style emphasizes grandeur and lacks adaptability.

<br>

While resting at the Woyun Hill Inn, if [[Zhao Huo]] loses to him, [[Long Xiang]] will take over. Fang Zhen Tian will bet that if he wins, he can sit on Zhao Huo's lap at the wine tower, even boasting about staying at the inn. [[Long Xiang]] is highly skilled in martial arts, but when faced with the killer from the Jinxiang Palace, [[Long Yuan Seven Masters]], he could barely stand after just two moves and almost lost his life.

<br>

During the Fengyu Mountain Conference, if he fights [[Shangguan Jun]], impressed by his courage, Shangguan Jun proposes a deal to exchange ten moves and give him a flashy nickname. The outcome is unclear, but according to Fang Zhen Tian himself, he lost.

<br>

In the Western Wulin battle, if he faces [[Zhao Huo]], he loses due to his easy-going nature. If he encounters [[Hua Zhong Xian]], captivated by his beauty, he hesitates to kill and gets acupoint struck, rendering him unconscious.
