<br><br>

A famous beauty of Jinxiang Palace, her face looks like a painting scroll, but in reality, she is a master of disguise.
<br><br>
Disguised as a member of the Tang Clan, known as Senior Sister Hua Xian Er, she is suspected of having an affair with [[Tang Zheng|Second Senior Brother]] and even beats up Zhao Huo.
<br><br>
She is the younger sister of [[Lady Wen]]. During the siege of Jinxiang Palace at the Martial Arts Tournament, she and Lady Wen staged a performance to survive the crisis, but Long Xiang saw through her disguise at a glance.

## Notes

-   Unrivaled in verbal combat.
-   After Tang Zheng fed the Sect Leader Tang Zhong Ling the Heart Devouring Pill, he stole the Jade Blood Stone and met with Hua Zhong Xian.
-   Upon her first visit to Jinxiang Palace, the more favorable Tang Zheng felt towards her, the easier it was for her to guide him.
-   On the windy mountain, Zhao Huo could smell the Beyond Immortal Fragrance used by Jinxiang Palace, which belonged to the Tang Clan. ~~The more he thought about it, the more suspicious it seemed~~
-   Highly skilled in martial arts, Zhao Huo was powerless to defend himself and died with a single blow.
-   Her martial arts style focuses on evasion and defense, but she was unable to overcome the full defensive capabilities of Nan Gong Shen on the windy mountain. When disguised as Tang Xian Er, the martial arts moves she used from the Tang Clan were all superficial, lacking in true essence, only mimicking the form without the substance.
-   <MarkdownWrapper>||The second-generation master of disguise.||</MarkdownWrapper> (v3206 decryption information)
-   Knows how to eat but too lazy to learn how to cook.[^1]
-   As long as she can find ways to please [[Tang Zheng|Second Senior Brother]], she will have Zhao Huo catch chickens and rabbits for her.
-   In the incident of female disciples fetching firewood, although she was not involved, she joined the female disciples in beating up Zhao Huo.[^2]
