Yu Lin, known as the "Silver Fish of Illusion Waves," is the water protector of the Kongtong Sect.
<br><br>
Although he holds this position, he has not yet married or had children, considering passing on his duties to someone else to compete for the sect leader's position.
<br><br>
Xiahou Lan does not think highly of his abilities, comparing him unfavorably to Third Xiang.
