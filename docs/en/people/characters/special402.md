> "Everything comes with a price. We are drifting further away from the best days, never to return to the past."

Formerly known as Su Ying Xiang, the master of Jinxiang Palace and the mentor of Long Xiang. Skilled in using music to heal or harm with sound waves, she inherited internal skills from the Wen siblings and combined them with the ecstatic demon qin skills to create her own unique style. She founded the Jinxiang Palace, sheltering unfortunate women who were victims of societal prejudices. Her methods were strict, and she was feared by all in the martial world.
<br><br>
Before the incident with Xiahou Lan, she was once considered the most beautiful woman in the martial world. She had known Shang Guan Jun since childhood, and the playful Shang Guan Jun often bullied her with his friends. Being a geisha, she was timid and fearful due to the teachings of the music house, and she feared this wealthy young man. As they grew up, Shang Guan Jun found her increasingly beautiful and talented, pressuring the music house to hand her over. At this time, the young hero Nan Gong Yuan rescued her, winning her heart.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, it all turned out to be a dream. When Nan Gong Yuan saw his good friend Wen Wu Wei severely injured, he couldn't bear to see him die with regret, so he gave Ying Xiang to him, causing a rift between them for twenty years. Wang Er Zhuang shaved his head and became a monk, and Shang Guan Jun also gave up on love. After Wen Wu Wei's death, Nan Gong Yuan visited her at Jinxiang Pavilion, not seeking reconciliation but wanting to make amends. She, unwilling to forgive, used drugs and qin music to confuse his mind, leading him to be with an ugly woman, resulting in the birth of Nan Gong Qian.
<br><br>
Later, Long Yuan disappeared and changed his name, and she took in his daughter Long Xiang. Wang Er Zhuang returned to see her after joining the beggar gang, but she could only love one person in her lifetime, so they became sworn siblings.
<br><br>
When Rui Xing was eleven, she wanted to learn about human nature by offering the palace as a gift to become her apprentice, leading to the creation of Jinxiang Palace. Although Rui Xing called her master, there was no real master-disciple relationship between them.
<br><br>
She was actually the Human Dao King of the Ni Jiao sect. She was exposed by Nan Gong Qian at the martial arts conference, and despite Jinxiang Palace's reputation, she couldn't overcome the prejudices of the martial world. Seeing the situation was dire, in order to protect Jinxiang Palace, she signaled Hua Zhong Xian to impersonate Lady Wen, while she pretended to control the entire palace as a demon using corpse heart pills, taking the blame for the Human Dao incident. She then died with Nan Gong Yuan in a suicide pact, buried in the Nan Gong family tomb.

## Notes

-   Ming Yu, Hua Zhong Xian, Long Xiang, and Sheng Xue all practiced a dual silk technique and sword technique that combined offense and defense, making them the best choices for protection. Unfortunately, they were separated during the Feng Yu Mountain incident and were defeated by Shang Guan Jun.
-   Shang Guan Jun: "Su Ying Xiang. You gave your heart to Nan Gong Yuan, your body to Wen Wu Wei, your twenty years of friendship to Wang Er Zhuang, then give your life to me as payment, this is what you owe me."
-   Shang Guan Jun referred to her as the orphan of a traitor minister.
-   Nan Gong Qian is suspected to be the child she had with Nan Gong Yuan after drugging him, but this is currently only one side of the story from Yuan Wu Xian.
-   If there had been no Feng Yu Mountain incident and Jinxiang Palace was disbanded, she planned to travel to the northeast and settle down near Changbai Mountain to retire.
-   She made ginseng chicken soup, giving both chicken legs to Long Xiang. She was skilled, but Zhao Huo had the potential to surpass her.
-   There is a saying in the martial world, "True feelings or false intentions, the pipa questions the heart." Anyone who wishes to marry someone from Jinxiang Palace must first listen to Lady Wen play a piece on the pipa. If the listener lacks internal strength and mental fortitude, they will fall into an illusion, revealing their true nature. This could lead to embarrassment or even harm to their meridians and spirit.
