## Biography

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Biography One">
	Xie Wu Chen, although a member of the righteous faction, is competitive and always eager for battle, often challenging renowned experts and suffering setbacks as a result.<br><br>
	His unique skill, "Wind Thunder Divine Leg," is a combination of his family's "Wind God Steps" and Emei's "Thunder Divine Leg," allowing him to kick while borrowing force, delivering lethal blows in mid-air.<br><br>
	The nickname "Wind God" was obtained by paying five taels of silver to have it spread, as he did not naturally possess such a prestigious title.

## Notes

-   Known as the "Twin Stars of Shu," representing the Flying Hero [[Tang Buyi]] and Xie Wu Chen.
-   Despite being compared to the hero "Cloud Dragon" from Liangshan, he disliked using ancestral nicknames and instead, upon others' advice, paid ten taels to have a scholar come up with a new one, then paid another five taels to spread it, changing it to "Wind God."
-   After being called Wind God, [[Tang Buyi]] became happier and would jokingly bow to him, even offering incense, ~~which was quite a hassle~~.
-   While ranking just below [[Xiang Wuyou|Sect Leader]] in the Emei Sect, his level of responsibility and skill cannot match that of [[Tang Buyi]].
-   During a banquet hosted by the [[Shangguan Family]] for imperial envoys, Xie Wu Chen encountered the [[White Shark Gang|Hungry Ghost Sect]] causing trouble for the people. Seeking to display his power before [[Shangguan Ying]], he confronted Liu E and demanded his execution. However, Liu E quickly grabbed a passerby's sword and used it to neutralize Xie Wu Chen's attacks, leaving him frustrated and defeated. He was forced to rename his "Wind Thunder Divine Leg" to "[[Kicking with Great Force]]" and tearfully retreated to Emei Mountain, staying indoors for a while.
-   If Zhao Huo claimed to have a good relationship with Liu E, Xie Wu Chen would immediately sever ties, very straightforwardly.
-   After another defeat against Wang Erzhuang during the siege of Jiangling, Xie Wu Chen loudly declared his retirement, but the sect leader praised his lightness and leg techniques as top-notch, suggesting he lacked in meditation and inner cultivation.
-   In a bid to determine the winner, he led soldiers to battle the water bandits' stronghold with [[Tang Buyi]] for ten days, only to be severely reprimanded by [[Xiang Wuyou]] upon their return to the mountain. This event was known in the martial world as the "Mianyang Pond Incident."
-   He once traveled with [[Tang Buyi]], [[Xiahou Lan]], and two herders from the northern frontier, exploring the martial world.
-   While he never visited a brothel with [[Tang Buyi]], he was once tricked into paying the bill.
-   In his matches against [[Tang Buyi]], Xie Wu Chen won twenty-nine times, lost thirty times, and tied forty-seven times. However, the competition was not always martial; [[Tang Buyi]] would challenge him to see who could drink more, followed by who could spend more extravagantly, all to avoid paying for drinks.
-   In terms of physical strength and foundation, he surpassed his senior brother [[Tang Buyi]], leading to frequent defeats in the martial world. His combat record did not compare to his senior brother's due to [[Tang Buyi]]'s cunning nature, making Xie Wu Chen an opponent who was not worth provoking. Unlike [[Tang Buyi]], who was sly and avoided unnecessary fights, Xie Wu Chen was martial-minded, combative, and valued his reputation. When encountering famous martial artists in the martial world, he often sought to learn from them, inevitably leading to confrontations. [[Tang Buyi]] referred to him as lacking, but not in martial arts skills.
