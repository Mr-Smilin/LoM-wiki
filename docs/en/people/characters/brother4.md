## Notes

-   [[Tang Zhongling|Clan Leader]] once said, "On a snowy day the following year, I found Wei Yuan; two years later, I had Ling Er." This indicates that the fourth senior brother is two years older than the junior sister.
-   Constellation unknown
-   Due to his travels as a merchant, he often doesn't sleep in his bedroom, but when he returns, everyone ends up sleeping very crowded.
-   Enjoys eating fried dough sticks
-   Described as a character whose favorability increases with spending - Bird Bear[^2]
-   Ambitious, in his eyes, money naturally leads to women. As for women like [[Shangguan Ying]] who are good at making money, he only sees them as competitors.[^1]
-   The public tasks of the fourth senior brother often go unfulfilled because he frequently uses his purchasing duties to ask others to help him transport smuggled goods, then resells them at inflated prices. After tricking his fellow brothers once, no one falls for it again. When necessary, he pushes [[Zhao Huo]] forward to divert attention.
-   Cautious and almost cowardly. Always advocates for peaceful resolutions and rarely resorts to violence. When [[Tang Buyi|First Senior Brother]] was misunderstood and attacked by [[Long Xiang]], he, as a martial artist, went to the yamen to plead for justice, defending an ordinary citizen.
-   Despite being greedy, he is quite loyal to family and friends. Thanks to Zhao Huo, he shares half of the money he extorted from [[Chao He]] with him. When [[Tang Mo Ling|Junior Sister]] got married, he spared no expense, taking the initiative to arrange the wedding preparations to ensure she had a grand wedding.
