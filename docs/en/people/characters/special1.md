The Hungry Ghost Path King of the Mud Sect, who rules the Ghost Island in the East Sea as the leader of the [[White Shark Gang]], is certified by the court as the number one rogue in the world, with a bounty higher than the Heavenly King [[Che Xuanyuan]].

<br>

Causing chaos in the East Sea, he often leads his followers to rob merchant and official ships. If they capture officials, they show no mercy, stripping them naked and parading them in public. Not only do they smuggle salt, but they also maliciously disrupt the official salt market by half giving away and half selling it.

<br>

It is said that he has been seen riding a giant white shark, dragging famous heroes from the Central Plains behind him with a rope.

## Notes

-   Insanely wild ™[^4]
-   Bird Bear's Facebook introduction: [Link](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=173139075084279&set=pcb.173139115084275)
-   Even his gang members are afraid of him when he goes crazy.
-   His mouth is huge like a shark's.
-   Whether those teeth are natural, Bird Bear doesn't know. [^1]
-   He knows Japanese because he often visits Japan and has even kidnapped Japanese pirates. [^1]
-   His intelligence seems to be extremely high, too wild! [^4]

### Martial Arts

-   His famous techniques are "Provoking the Sword," "Three-legged Disrespect" (without the third leg), and his ultimate move is "Shadow Strike."
-   His moves are based on countermeasures against [[Che Xuanyuan]]'s martial arts. The Three-legged Disrespect and Provoking the Sword are derived from the Shadow Strike. [^3]
-   "Provoking the Sword" forces the opponent to attack, an extremely evil technique.
-   Training the testicles to be tough allows the Three-legged Disrespect to be the strongest move, but it requires a precise kick. [^2]
-   He doesn't need to kick hard when targeting the testicles, just a clever move to make them spin five times, causing the spermatic cord to twist and die, and you only realize the problem the next day after waking up. Surprisingly, his martial arts are unexpectedly skillful. [^3]
-   He usually grabs whatever weapon is at hand, whether it's a knife, spear, stick, or sword, he can use it. [^1]
-   [[Xiahou Lan]] commented that Liu E's martial arts style is wickedly clever. It's not ruthless or evil, just plain wicked.

### Relationships

-   He provokes those who appear self-righteous, destroying their beliefs. [^4]
-   He once wanted to find an opportunity to take down [[Che Xuanyuan]]. [^4]
-   He kidnapped [[Shangguan Ying]], indirectly causing [[Nangong Shen]] to regret his marriage.
-   He attacked the [[Southern Song Mountain Temple]] with a rolling pin, beat the abbot, forced him to run naked in the street, had his associates slice fish to feed the dogs on the abbot's body, which deeply traumatized the abbot and made him retire that day. [[Shi Ming]] was fortunately traveling outside at that time and narrowly escaped. 
-   He has a deep enmity with [[Xie Wuchen]], not only defeating him publicly but also forcing him to rename his unique skill "Thunderous Wind Kick" to "[[Kick with Great Force]]," humiliating him to the extreme.
-   He has never met [[Nangong Shen]], but they mutually dislike each other. [[Nangong Shen]] sees him as a major threat, while Liu E doesn't consider him a worthy opponent. [^2]
-   He admires [[Lady Wen]]. [^2]
-   His relationship with [[Wang Erzhuang]] is somewhat complex, as they share similarities in nature, with elements of both agreement and disagreement, but they respect each other's way of life. [^2]

### Others

-   His kindness to commoners is to make them resent the government, to undermine the legitimacy of the imperial regime, instigate the people to rebel, and make the authorities uncomfortable. [^4]
-   Some commoners may voluntarily join the [[White Shark Gang]] after realizing Liu E's goals and becoming dissatisfied with the court. [^4]
-   In the initial version, the evil duo of [[Zhao Huo]] had a storyline where they could kidnap [[Tang Moling|Junior Sister Tang]], but after failing, she wandered into the White Shark Gang and ate fish for half a year, almost bankrupting the gang, until she was rescued by the [[Shangguan Family]]. When the [[Tang Clan]] was exterminated, Liu E saved her. At that time, [[Zhao Huo]] appeared, and if he defeated Liu E, he would be struck dead by heavenly thunder. Some players were dissatisfied, so this storyline was removed.
