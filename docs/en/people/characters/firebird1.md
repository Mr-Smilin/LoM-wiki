> "Gah—!"

The immortal crane raised by Yu Xiaomei from Kongtong Sect's Feitian Gate, has an extremely unpleasant cry.
<br><br>
Often caught by Xiaomei to practice dancing with the Crane's Disappearing Fist, one can't help but wonder what sins were committed in a past life to end up in her hands.

## Notes

-   Resembles the flying broomstick from "Harry Potter."
-   Xiaomei will have Firebird join in when sparring with Zhao Huo in Tangmen. ~~No mercy~~
-   The game does not explicitly state Firebird's gender, but Bird Bear claims it's female. [^1]
-   After being confirmed as female, her popularity skyrocketed. ~~Everyone must have a "Strange Tales" spirit~~
-   The red spot on a crane's head becomes more prominent when excited or courting. ~~Could it be in heat all year round~~
-   Considering Firebird is female, ~~could Zhao Huo be the object of her affection~~
-   Bird Bear later mentioned in an interview that Firebird only likes cranes of the same species and does not have feelings for Zhao Huo. ~~Humans and cranes walk different paths, alas~~ [^2]
