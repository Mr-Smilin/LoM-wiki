# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Known as the "King of Joy", Li Renyou was the former ruthless leader of the Joyful Sect, also the master of the legendary assassin organization, the Thousand Lantern Tower, and the biological father of the Western Xia Emperor Xia Xiangzong.

<br>

Possessing even more powerful inner strength than the left envoy and more fierce swordsmanship than the right envoy, he mastered the Nine Revolutions Reincarnation and the Swallowing Heaven Treasure Mirror. With decades of demonic cultivation, he stood unparalleled in ancient and modern times. Wielding the Ghost Lotus King Blade, his movements would make ghosts cry and gods howl, sending shivers down the spine of even the Thousand-Mile Pengcheng.

<br>

Defeated by Longyuan in the Battle of the Joyful Sect, Li Renyou used the "Nine Revolutions Reincarnation Great Method," one of the three treasures of the Joyful Sect, to possess another body, reincarnating as Shentu Long.
