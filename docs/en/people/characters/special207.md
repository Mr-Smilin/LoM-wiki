[[Thousand Lamps Tower]] incense, second only to the tower master's head disciple, before being subdued by the [[Kongtong Sect|Kongtong]] sect, committed many evils, known as the Nine Lives Leopard. Pretending to reform, he entered the Buddhist gate, actually following the orders of the Thousand Lamps Tower to infiltrate Kongtong, with other major plans in mind. He is deeply trusted by the [[Fire Dragon Immortal Lord]], treated as an equal, and barring any unexpected events, is the next head disciple.

<br>

He possesses the unique martial art "Fierce Sun Hammer," also known as the "Soul Snatching Staff," originating from the evil arts of the [[Paradise Sect]], with a secret saying: "One strike dims the fetal light, two strikes scatter the spirit, three strikes disperse the essence." It contains hidden energy, hitting the target allows true energy to rush into the brain, causing a dazed and dreamy state all day, turning the victim into a compliant mute fool. This is the nemesis of the Soul Snatching Sect's martial arts, with the head of the Soul Snatching Sect seeking countermeasures, taking elite disciples into seclusion in a mountain cave, by the time [[Zhao Huo]] entered the Kongtong Sect, it had been half a year.

<br>

He personally trained [[Yu Xiao Mei|Xiao Mei]] in the art of killing, the person Xiao Mei hates the most in her life.

<br>

Appearing as a fat man, he actually wears human skin, able to escape like a cicada shedding its skin when things go south.

## Notes

-   Some texts refer to the Soul Snatching Staff as the Mourning Soul Staff, possibly an alias.
-   Naturally cruel, he has killed many famous male and female heroes. Before taking their lives, he must humiliate and defile them, capturing their ugly state before death as cherished mementos.
