	But she remains optimistic and unconcerned.<br><br>
	Loving and playful, everyone in Diancang dotes on her,<br>
	Able to command the winds and rain.<br><br>
	Although she practices Diancang martial arts under her brother's supervision,<br>
	her physical condition limits her progress, even though she remembers everything by heart, she struggles to advance,<br>
	even walking a bit faster makes her breathless, let alone wielding a sword.<br><br>
	With no particular hobbies, she is curious about the world below the mountains.<br><br>
	She dislikes hardship, hates taking medicine, and will vomit if forced to swallow it,<br>
	After vomiting, she will mock people with a smirk.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Two">
	For some reason, she descended the mountain with her brother,<br>
	only to be pursued by Diancang disciples.<br><br>
	Many in the martial world covet her, so she has to hide her whereabouts.<br>
	Choosing to wander aimlessly despite having a carefree life, she prefers to roam the world freely.<br><br>
	The hardships of travel have increased her feverish episodes,<br>
	Whenever she feels faint, she can sleep peacefully by holding onto her brother's clothes.<br><br>
	"As long as my brother is here, I don't need anything else, just like before..."
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Three">
	She harbors a significant secret.<br>
	The great-grandfather of the Ye siblings was one of the trusted generals under Yue Yun, the son of the famous anti-Jin general Wu Muwang.<br><br>
	It is said that Emperor Gaozong issued twelve gold plaques, and Yue Fei, loyal to the end, willingly sacrificed himself,<br>
	but lamented that the anti-Jin cause remained unfinished, fearing that the empire would be helpless if the military power fell into the wrong hands.<br>
	Thus, the main force of the Yue family army was dispersed, and the treasure was hidden in the mountains, with the iron token entrusted to the eldest son Yue Yun for safekeeping,<br>
	hoping that in the future, the token could command the old troops and inherit the mission of protecting the country.<br><br>
	Unexpectedly, Yue Yun died before his father, entrusting the token to a subordinate in a time of crisis,<br>
	instructing him to hide in the martial world and await the descendants of Wu Mu to retrieve it.<br>
	That subordinate then concealed his identity, lived in the mountains and forests, posing as a bandit, but in reality, he guarded the token for three generations.<br><br>
	This secret was kept for nearly a hundred years, but eventually became known to others,<br>
	The treasure and token attracted disaster, as their parents feared the token falling into the wrong hands, leading to a massacre, they branded the token on their beloved daughter's back before abandoning it.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Four">
	On the day her family was destroyed, the young Yunshang was struck by a palm from a martial arts expert hired by the court,<br>
	her meridians were severed, half of her body paralyzed, and she seemed unlikely to survive.<br><br>
	Fortunately, a senior from the Diancang Faction happened to be passing by, dispersed the enemies in time,<br>
	protected her vital points with internal energy, and used all the miraculous medicines in his possession to barely save her life.<br>
	From then on, she and her brother naturally joined the Diancang Faction.<br><br>
	She always knew that those who flattered her were only after the secret she held,<br>
	even her master who saved her life was enticed by the treasure her brother possessed,<br>
	Except for her brother, no one in the faction could be at peace.<br><br>
	Despite her carefree appearance, she was always cautious, growing up in hatred.<br>
	Until you appeared. Although you are not handsome,<br>
	But the fact that you are willing to disregard the treasure for her sake makes her feel secure,<br>
	At the same time, she inexplicably feels a bit jealous of the unseen little junior sister.
