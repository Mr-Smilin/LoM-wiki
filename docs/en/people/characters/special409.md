# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Known as the "Constellation of Heaven," the Celestial Way King of the [[Mud Sect]], residing deep in the Six Paths Gorge without leaving.

<br>

The first master of the Shaolin Temple on Mount Song, Master Jue Kong, intended to eliminate harm for the people. He ventured into the tiger's den at great risk, although he saved his life, he returned completely changed.

<br>

His skill in the "Heavenly King Collapse Frame" Qi-breaking chapter is extremely domineering. Just a touch can destroy the opponent's dantian, causing them to self-destruct their meridians and die.

<br>

The current version (v1.0.3206) has no role at all.

## Remarks

- Bird Bear said he can be seen as the invincible superhero of the [[Mud Sect]].[^1]
- His martial arts skills cannot be learned by others, and he has no disciples. Others only use his martial arts strategies as a reference to improve their own skills.[^2]
