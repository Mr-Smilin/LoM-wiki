> "Just like the clam. Donor, have you asked the fish and shrimp for their wishes? I guess not, you only think of yourself."

A young monk from the Mount Song Sect, wandering through the Song Dynasty.

Gifted with intelligence and a sharp tongue, he often travels between the Emei and Kongtong sects, promoting Buddhism while raising funds to build the Mount Song Pagoda.

He treats kind-hearted individuals with respect, but confronts the stubborn with force. Known as the "Poor-mouthed Monk," he earned this nickname after verbally defeating Xiao Mei, and used the Mount Song "Stance Kicking - Thousand Gold Fall" to save his life when Xiao Mei tried to push him down the stairs.
