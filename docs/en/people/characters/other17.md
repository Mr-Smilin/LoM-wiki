<br><br>

An old beggar from the Beggar Gang, whose real name is unknown, raised [[Fan Xiaotian]] and called her Ah Gou.

<br>

He claims that the old school is the true Beggar Gang. The [[Wang Erzhuang|leader]] is a fake beggar, a pseudo-gentleman who talks about benevolence and morality.

<br>

During the Fengyu Mountain meeting, when voting on how to deal with the Tang Sect, he suggested that [[Li Fugui]] should align with the larger group.

## Notes

-   Common standing portrait
-   The person who taught Fan Xiaotian the famous quote "Dogs don't have dog mothers, but you do!"
-   If in the initial battle in Jiangling, the dice rolls favor the official troops, after winning and capturing fifty percent and the mad dog, he will be seen taking the mad dog back when fishing with the Southern Palace Old Master.
