The Emei Sect Leader, self-proclaimed as Xiang Mou, possesses extraordinary elegance and a demeanor reminiscent of a celestial being. A devout Buddhist, he highly respects those who practice kindness and accumulate virtue.
<br><br>
An unparalleled master, he once secluded himself from the world for many years, forgetting about worldly affairs. He comprehended the "Formless Fist" based on Xingyi Quan, nearly reaching a state of no moves or techniques. This martial art form is akin to the Tang Sect's "Forgetful Heart Chapter," demonstrating different paths leading to the same ultimate truth in martial arts.
<br><br>
Unfazed, he faced several formidable opponents at the martial arts tournament.

## Notes

-   The Sect Leader took on the role in a time of crisis.
-   Although reluctant to be the Sect Leader, he would not pass the position to [[Jie Wu Chen]] as he is highly unreliable. 
-   He is proficient in the Emei Sect's secret technique, the [[Thunder God Kick]].
-   Xia Hou Lan from the Western Martial Arts Line sought his guidance, and after exchanging a few moves, they mutually admired each other. However, when he mentioned his past connection with [[Third Xiang]], he was pursued and attacked.
-   He met [[Third Xiang]] in a social setting within the martial arts community.
