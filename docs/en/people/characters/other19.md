# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Qianjin Old Man, a senior member of the old faction of the [[Beggar Gang]], known as "Qianjin Old Man," had a son named [[Li Fugui]].

<br>

With previous official titles to his name, he depleted his family fortune and joined the [[Beggar Gang]] for the sake of righteousness in the martial arts world. In reality, it was because he was caught embezzling and knew he couldn't escape the government's investigation. So, he spent the whole night giving away his wealth to beggars to gain a good reputation and hide in the gang, pretending to be a thief catcher and claiming innocence from the authorities. Young individuals like [[Wang Erzhuang]] and [[Nangong Yuan]] were deceived by him, thinking he was a good person, with Nangong Yuan admiring his generosity.

<br>

After joining the gang, he used his influence to make the gang members earn ill-gotten money for him, collecting the remnants of the defeated [[Pure Bliss Sect|Old Demon Sect]] from twenty years ago, killing the men as they were worthless and mutilating the women to be used as playthings for his subordinates. Any children born were either sold to the Jin Kingdom or subjected to cruel treatment, pretending to be born with disabilities to elicit sympathy from passersby and deceive them for money. Since the victims were all martial artists and not ordinary civilians, the government turned a blind eye, allowing Qianjin Old Man to exploit this loophole and amass wealth through immoral means.

<br>

In the end, he was killed by a palm strike from [[Wang Erzhuang]] at a large meeting of the Beggar Gang, leaving his orphaned son, [[Li Fugui]], to become Wang Erzhuang's adopted son.
