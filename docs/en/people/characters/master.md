> "Why become a dragon abyss? You can become anyone."

Born as Tang Zhong Ling, currently serving as the head of the Tang Clan.
<br><br>
With a fierce temperament and a strong sense of justice, he was once a legendary figure ranked among the top ten martial artists. However, as he aged, his physical condition deteriorated significantly, and his renowned skill, the "Fei Yan Liu Xing Ling," gradually faded away.
<br><br>
During the [Battle of Ji Le Sect](/event/stories/決戰極樂教), he resorted to forcibly enhancing his power by ingesting poison, using the "Fei Yan Liu Xing Ling" to eliminate the Right Guardian, but this act left him with a lingering illness.

## Notes

-   Due to poor stomach health, he needs to eat lighter meals and often consumes rice porridge.
-   ~~After falling ill, he may wake up startled due to the rice porridge, increasing affection~~
-   The plot of him with white hair during the temple robbery twenty years ago was simply due to the lack of preparation for a younger version's illustration. [^1]
-   In his youth, he may have appeared as a rogue. [^2]
-   The rebellious nature of [[Tang Bu Yi|Senior Brother]] and the arrogance of [[Tang Zheng|Second Brother]] mirror the demeanor of the head in the past. However, since falling ill, his temperament has changed significantly, becoming more approachable.
-   He was once a supreme master who stood above all, listed as one of the top ten heroes of the Central Plains by the Gengyang Reading Pavilion. [^3]
-   Many of the troubles he caused during his youth in the martial world were resolved thanks to the influence of [[Nan Gong Heng|Elder Nan Gong]], making major issues trivial and minor issues insignificant. Upon hearing of the passing of [[Nan Gong Heng|Elder Nan Gong]], he mourned as if he had lost a family elder.
-   Despite his resentment towards the corrupt and oppressive court, he greatly respects loyal officials and filial sons. Despite his ambiguous nature, he shows great respect towards those in the Buddhist community.
-   In his youth, he once chased down a frivolous young nobleman who flirted with a certain [[Tang Lu|Senior Sister]], forcing the nobleman to flee to the Fujian branch of the Mount Song Sect seeking refuge under Abbot [[Shi Ming]]. He knocked on the door a hundred times until both the heads of the Nan Gong and Shang Guan families came to persuade him to leave. Only then did he reluctantly depart, causing [[Shi Ming]] to suffer from inner demons.
