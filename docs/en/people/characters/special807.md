As a creditor of the Tang Clan, the Lü Family's business in the Shu region is relatively small, and they have business dealings with the Shangguan Family.
<br><br>
The Tang Clan mortgaged their outer fort and farmland to him. Initially, he wanted to open an inn at the outer fort, but business was poor. Later, he tried to raise horses, which also ended in failure. Eventually, he simply rented it out and left it unattended. The farmland was also not fertile, without proper fertilization, making it difficult to deal with pests, something only the Tang Clan could manage.

## Notes

-   The image is a shared illustration of a merchant.
-   If seen by the [[Tang Zhongling|Clan Leader]] before, [[Zhao Huo]] will remember burning calligraphy and paintings and having low morals, providing some entertainment when Lü Weng comes to look at the artwork.
