# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

The Four Young Masters of Huacheng, also known as the companions of Nangong Shen, are regulars in the Yanyu Liu Alley. Apart from Nangong Shen himself, they are Chen Xu, Yu Zhiyong, Cheng Xi, and Gongzi Xiu.

<br>

Chen Xu, encountered during the Longxiang Temple incident, has a history with Lady Fei from the Jinxiang Palace, deceiving the wife of a Quanzhen Daoist, and even being a traitor from the "Dragon Raising Garden" in the Jin Dynasty. He had his fingers cut off by Longxiang, tried to blind her with lime powder, and was eventually killed by a sword.

<br>

Yu Zhiyong, a skilled martial artist who came with the extermination line to attack Tan Badao and Muxiangu together.

<br>

Cheng Xi, at the Fengyu Mountain Conference, opposed Zhao Huo becoming a member of the Wulin Alliance.

<br>

Gongzi Xiu, not yet implemented in v3206, on 10/5/2024, had [public information](https://www.facebook.com/100076301525150/posts/554404723779574) on the Bird Bear FB. He is very wealthy, loves flowers, but does not plant them himself because the soil is dirty and there are bugs. Every morning, he wears different flowers out for a walk, takes a sniff, and then discards them.

## Notes

- Are there five members of the Four Young Masters of Huacheng? Isn't it common knowledge that the Four Great Heavenly Kings are five?[^1]
- According to Shangguan Ying's evaluation, the Four Young Masters of Huacheng rely on their family wealth and appearance, playing with the decency of good women.
