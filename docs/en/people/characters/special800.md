## Biography

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Biography One">
	Appointed as the Baoan Lang of He'an, although only a seventh-rank official, with the title of carrying a sword before the emperor, no one, even a high-ranking official, could insult him at will. He was the emperor's blade and took pride in it.<br><br>
	Unless it was the emperor, he never showed arrogance or humility to anyone. This was not only the expectation of the emperor but also the courage he had gained from the martial world.<br><br>
	If he discovered corrupt officials, he dared to arrest them, but he was also very compassionate. While he strictly followed the law, he would turn a blind eye in certain situations, showing leniency when necessary.

  <Tab title="Biography Two">
	He once captured a young girl who had been imprisoned in a cellar, stabbed the villain to protect herself during her escape.<br><br>
	Out of compassion, he released the innocent perpetrator, but his brother's political enemies seized this opportunity and reported him to the Ministry of Justice.<br><br>
	Song Bei argued firmly, "The legal system has been in place for two hundred years, and times have changed. It is not suitable to stick to old rules. Moreover, laws were made by our ancestors, who, despite their high positions, may not understand the people's sentiments, leading to flaws. I show leniency where the law falls short of justice, and I have no guilt in my heart."<br><br>
	However, his defense failed, and Song Bei was fined half a year's salary and confined to his residence. Fortunately, with his brother's influence in court and the petitions from the people, the Ministry of Justice revoked the order and granted him a pardon.
