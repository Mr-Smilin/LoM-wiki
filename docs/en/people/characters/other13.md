# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Wen Wuwei, known as the "Seven Transformation Saint" of Emei, has a younger sister named Wen Wuxia, also known as the "Blue Flute Fairy." He is referred to as "Big Brother Wen" by Nangong Yuan.
<br><br>
Twenty years ago, he pursued Su Yingxiang along with Nangong Yuan, Shangguan Jun, and Wang Chunxiao.
<br><br>
During the Great Battle of the Pure Land Sect, he fell into a trap and was surrounded. He sacrificed himself to save Nangong Yuan and Su Yingxiang, resulting in severe injuries. While lying in bed, he kept calling out Yingxiang's name in his delirium. Nangong Yuan, unable to bear seeing him suffer from lovesickness until death, persuaded Su Yingxiang to marry him.
<br><br>
Shortly after their marriage, he seemingly died from his severe injuries.

## Notes

- There is a description stating that "Su Yingxiang eventually married Wen Dashan, who did not understand martial arts," but since he is known as the Seven Transformation Saint, he must have some martial arts skills. It is unclear why there is a contradiction.
