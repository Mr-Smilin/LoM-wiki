# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

The first emperor of the historical Great Mongol Empire, Genghis Khan (1162 May 31 - 1227 August 25).
<br><br>
In a demo about the journey through the desert, he summoned [[Zhao Huo]], [[Rui Xing]], and [[Qiu Chuji|Qiu Zhenren]] to his tent, seeking the secret to immortality. Qiu Zhenren advised against killing, urging the Khan to cease warfare and cultivate virtue; Rui Xing suggested the Khan should follow the will of heaven and make bold decisions in his lifetime; Zhao Huo, feeling reluctant in his heart, mentioned that the Khan might not finish his battles before his imminent death. In the end, when Zhao Huo was caught having inappropriate thoughts about Rui Xing by Genghis Khan, he was put on the wanted list.
