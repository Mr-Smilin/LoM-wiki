<br><br>

The head of the Nan Gong Family, an idealist. He has two sons, [[Nan Gong Shen]] and [[Nan Gong Qian]].
<br><br>
He once saved the number one beauty in the martial arts world, the courtesan [[Lady Wen|Su Yanxiang]], from the clutches of Shangguan Jun, winning her heart. However, Nan Gong Yuan rejected the feelings of [[Lady Wen|Su Yanxiang]] and gave her to his severely injured friend, [[Wen Wuwei]].
<br><br>
After the death of [[Wen Wuwei]], Nan Gong Yuan felt guilty and brought gifts to Lady Wen at the Jin Xiang Pavilion, not seeking reconciliation, but only seeking to make amends. Lady Wen used drugs and music to confuse his mind, leading him to spend a night with an ugly woman, resulting in the birth of [[Nan Gong Qian]]. Years later, the woman brought Qian to their home, but Nan Gong Yuan refused to acknowledge him.
<br><br>
Not a day goes by that Nan Gong Yuan does not regret his insincere words from that day, but the old grudges of Lady Wen are hard to dispel, leading to a twenty-year feud between the Nan Gong Family and the Jin Xiang Pavilion.
<br><br>
Twenty years ago, [[Wang Erzhuang|Wang Chunxiao]], [[Lady Wen|Su Yingxiang]], and [[Wen Wuwei]] jointly recommended him to be the leader of the martial arts alliance, but he admired the peerless martial arts of Long Yuan and willingly gave up the position. He was later elected as the new leader at the Feng Yu Mountain Conference, but during the chaos of the human world, Lady Wen stabbed his heart, not piercing it, but he stabbed himself deeper, dying in a double suicide with her.

## Notes

-   The title "Rotten Kezi" is only vaguely known to older martial artists. During the Jiangling battle, Wang Erzhuang used this title to call out Nan Gong Yuan.
-   His favorite Xuan Iron Yin Yang chessboard was made by the Tang Sect, capable of both attack and defense. The pieces on the chessboard can be used as hidden weapons, making it unpredictable. Made of magnetite, it specializes in collecting people's weapons, leading others to believe that Nan Gong Yuan has exceptional internal strength.
-   He has not seen Wang Erzhuang in twenty years, searching for him for many years, even going to the Gengyang Study Room and posting missing person notices, but to no avail.
-   Whether losing in chess skills or martial arts, he will always express admiration, but if the strong "Young Master Wang" makes a move, you are no match.
-   If asked about the identity of his powerful friend, he will hesitate and be unable to explain further. No one has ever seen this all-powerful imaginary friend of his.
