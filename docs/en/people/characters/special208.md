> "What's the point of showing off? I am an inner disciple now, call me Tang He from now on."

If [[Zhao Huo]] is ugly, then Chao He is ugly in both appearance and heart, beyond redemption.
<br><br>
Who is Chao He? Known in the martial arts world as the "Despicable Scoundrel," he doesn't deceive the clever, only the kind-hearted. He doesn't care if his actions tarnish the remaining goodness in the world, making good people less trusting, hoping that kind-hearted fools like you die early and never reincarnate.
<br><br>
Originally a disciple of the Tang Sect in Guangzhou, he kept the same hairstyle as [[Zhao Huo]], just with a slightly more prominent chin, pretending to be him to deceive and swindle, only to be caught and questioned by the Tang Sect in Shu. Surprisingly, he managed to survive by claiming [[Tang Xiaolou]] as his godmother, not only living but also joining the Tang Sect.
<br><br>
Even after joining, he remained unchanged, stealing [[Zhao Huo]]'s firewood pretending to work hard, inviting everyone to dinner but claiming he had no money, causing explosions by not following the instructions of [[Tang Zheng|Second Senior Brother]] in alchemy, and riding his godmother's horse to accidentally kill a dog from the Beggar's Sect. What's more, he never once thought he was wrong.
<br><br>
One day, he suddenly disappeared from the Tang Sect. Just when you thought you wouldn't have to see this scoundrel again, he reappeared, attacking [[Tang Buyi|First Senior Brother]] with Five-Color Mud to disrupt his martial arts skills, and even slandered [[Tang Zhongling|Sect Leader]] as a demon cult master at the martial arts conference.
<br><br>
You should never have let him go from the beginning.

## Conclusion

-   After the destruction of the Tang Sect, he enjoyed a carefree life in a brothel with money he swindled from [[Tang Moling|Junior Sister]].
-   After the events in the Western martial arts world, he once again impersonated [[Zhao Huo]], but was captured by vengeful members of the martial arts alliance and tortured to death for forty-nine days.

## Notes

-   Depending on the circumstances, he may have been captured by the Beggar's Sect/Cang Sect/[[Song Bei]].
-   [[Tang Zheng|Second Senior Brother]] wanted to poison him at first sight, making [[Zhao Huo]] surprisingly more likable in comparison.
-   Chao He would feign madness and helplessness without any scruples, utterly insignificant. People were unwilling to let [[Zhao Huo]] go because he was ugly and unwilling to accept his fate. On one hand, they looked down on him, but on the other hand, they feared he would turn his life around and couldn't bear to see him succeed, so they sought opportunities to take his head to prevent him from having a future, thus discouraging other weaker individuals from following suit. 
-   His facial features were actually quite different from [[Zhao Huo]], but he relied on others not daring to scrutinize closely. By deliberately imitating his attire and hairstyle, and claiming to be "Zhao Huo" and "Tang Sect's Ugly Hero," he managed to deceive those who were not very familiar with him.
-   Chao He had not bathed for many days, emitting a strong body odor, while [[Zhao Huo]] always had a faint medicinal scent around him. If one was familiar with [[Fan Xiaotian]], they could distinguish them by their smell.
