<br><br>
The eldest disciple under Huolong Xianjun, the head of the Feitian Gate in the Kongtong Sect.
<br><br>
He is straightforward, honest, and simple-minded, dedicated to seeking immortality. He follows Huolong Xianjun in cultivating Daoism and Magic, feeling extremely ashamed that he has not been able to breathe fire after years of practice.
<br><br>
Although he has not succeeded in cultivating immortality, he is a person with deep blessings. Through a series of coincidences, he learned the techniques of the Wind Blade and Fire Sword, which made his master jealous. He then deceived his way to the Song-Jin battlefield under the pretext that "to break through the Great Vehicle stage, one must accumulate merit," and "the fastest way to accumulate merit is to go to the battlefield to save the country."
<br><br>
However, he stayed on the battlefield and never died. Instead, he gained the trust of officers and soldiers, earning the title of "General of Dao and Magic." His military achievements were outstanding, and even the veteran general Zhao Fang of Xiangyang treated him with great respect.
<br><br>
When the news reached Kongtong, Huolong Xianjun was so angry that he turned upside down.

-   If he hadn't been deceived to the battlefield, he would have been the strongest candidate to lead the Kongtong Sect.
-   Wei Ju is dissatisfied with this, believing that he is irresponsible.
-   He once held a ceremony in the army to pray for rain, and it actually rained.[^1]
