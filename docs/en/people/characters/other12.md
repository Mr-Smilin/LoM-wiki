A disciple of Jinxiang Palace, nicknamed 'Jiye Ciding'.
<br><br>
During her time at Jinxiang Palace, every night she would climb to the top of the tower with a lamp, looking out over her hometown. One night, a fisherman returning home on the lake mistook her kind gesture of guiding with a lantern as a way to show the path, and thus the nickname spread.
<br><br>
She secretly loves [[Tang Buyi|Flying Hero]]. Under the cold night with a lamp, the Flying Hero arrived with two liang of wine. Listening to his lament of past events, she decisively went to his hometown of Suzhou and brought back a handful of soil.

## Notes

-   A supporting character with as little screen time as [[Xin Ru]], but with beautiful illustrations, unexpectedly gaining popularity among players(?)
-   Hailing from Pingjiang Prefecture, she speaks softly and gently.
-   In the game dialogues, she is referred to as a disciple of Jinxiang Palace, and Bird Bear has no intention of changing it. [^1]
-   She has known how to cook home-style dishes since she was young. [^2]
