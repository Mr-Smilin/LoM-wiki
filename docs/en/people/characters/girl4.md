-   Exceptional financial management skills, single-handedly supporting the [[Shangguan Family]] business, with an unusual perspective on money.
-   Earned not only money but also trust and connections, deeply rooting the [[Shangguan Family]] in the Song Kingdom. 
-   Since taking over the family business, she has traveled for business and adventure, monopolizing profits without deception, always emphasizing honesty in her dealings.
-   Specializes in heavy-duty hidden weapons like the Money Dart, directly throwing strings of copper coins at opponents, combined with the Distress Fist, making her unstoppable.
-   Was once kidnapped by [[Liu E]].
-   Had a prearranged marriage agreement with [[Xiahou Lan]], but due to constant crying and fussing, she was sent to the Fujian branch of the Songshan School to learn martial arts. The Snow Mountain School was later destroyed, ending the arrangement, ~~otherwise a union could have been possible~~.
-   Engaged to [[Nangong Shen]], but the engagement was called off after the Battle of Jiangling.
-   Daughter of a corrupt official who lacked compassion, according to [[Xiahou Lan]].
-   Juggling multiple responsibilities, with family members unsympathetic and strangers critical, facing constant gossip and curses, she had to maintain a friendly demeanor, leading to immense pressure, hence unleashing the Twelve Success Strength of the Distress Fist.
-   Supports shoulder armor, believing it exudes power, even trying to influence her seamstresses to create increasingly extravagant shoulder armor for wealthy clients.

-   If no fateful connections are made, she will eventually marry into the Hojo family in Japan.

-   When traveling, her servants bring royal tribute tea, Longfeng Group Tea, difficult to obtain casually, stolen and presented as a gift to the Shangguan family.
-   Has never experienced paternal love since childhood, shedding tears when her father, [[Shangguan Sun]], carried her away from the poisonous smoke.
-   <MarkdownWrapper>||Has always avoided vouching for others, having suffered great losses in her youth, almost being sold because of it.||</MarkdownWrapper>
