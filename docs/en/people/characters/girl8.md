## Biography

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Biography One">
    Trained at Jinxiang Palace, a graceful beauty with exceptional swordsmanship.<br>
    Following in her father's footsteps, she aspires to carry on his legacy and become a wandering hero.<br>
    Despite this, due to her lack of worldliness, she is easily deceived.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Two">
    Memories of her father are now faint.<br>
    In the distant memory of that day, he patted her head, smiled, and left, never to return.<br>
    Later, Jinxiang Palace's Madam Wen took her in and brought her into the fold.<br><br>   
    It was only through hearsay that she learned her father was a legendary figure in the martial arts world, a mix of sadness and pride. Following in her father's footsteps, she visited old acquaintances, seeking more stories of her deceased father to cherish.<br><br>
    Her swordsmanship was inherited from family secrets, particularly excelling in the Seven Secrets of Long Yuan, mastering swordsmanship. Since childhood, she used a drumstick as a sword, unconsciously realizing the secret of unity between man and sword. To this day, she is unsure if she truly qualifies as a master.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Three">
    Gradually becoming proficient in combat, she is now able to remain calm and composed, freely wielding her swordsmanship, becoming a renowned female hero.<br>
    Beautiful as a flower, she attracts a constant stream of admirers. Long Xiang's heart is beginning to open, but her awkwardness in love is evident. To cover her embarrassment, she makes friends through martial arts and swordplay.<br>
    As a result, suitors who seek her affection are often defeated by her sword, leaving disheveled and defeated. Even her comforting words cannot prevent their setbacks.<br>
    Those with high spirits often retreat and retire, which is not surprising. As skilled as she is in martial arts, her life is a mess, lacking self-sufficiency, and without someone to take care of her, she could end up harming herself.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Four">
    In the world, no one has been beaten by her more times than you.<br>
    No matter how hard she strikes, she becomes more relentless, while you become more reluctant to give up.<br><br>
    She is tired of the superficial and elegant martial artists who flaunt their skills and attire, preferring your integrity.<br><br>
    "My beloved, the greatest hero in the world, a great hero with an iron will, stands tall and proud."<br>
    Just like her father, she says, blushing for three days after, she will immediately draw her sword when she sees you.<br>
    But she cannot leave your care, and in the end, she can only suppress her shame and return to your side.<br><br>
    Occasionally, she tries to rise and fulfill the duties of a wife, causing accidents like tearing your clothes while sewing or burning down the house while cooking.<br><br>
    You better not expect too much from her.

## Titles

Jinxiang Palace Murderer, a title taken by Tang Buyi, later known to all.<br><br>
Drumstick Hero, capable of killing with a single drumstick. In the city of Yangcheng, ten thieves were killed by poor people who bought them off with drumsticks. These ten thieves were ruthless and powerful, and it is said that the wealth they looted could rival that of a city lord. Unfortunately, they met their end due to drumsticks, which is truly unjust.<br><br>
The sheep among sheep, a certified mobile money changer of the Beggars' Sect. Although beautiful and skilled in swordsmanship, she is extremely foolish, lacking any learning ability. Beggars' Sect disciples are delighted to encounter her, as she has succeeded in every trick in the "Jianghu Ghost Records"! Consistently successful, she is truly a remarkable individual. However, if anyone tries to flirt with her, she will counterattack in her dreams with her sword. Her swordsmanship in dreams is even more ruthless than when awake, never leaving anyone alive.<br><br>
Zhao Huo said that those saved by Long Xiang all say, "Heaven has eyes! Sending this white-robed Bodhisattva to help those in need!" Upon hearing the people talk about the Dragon Maiden, they all say she is a Bodhisattva with a sword.

## Poems

Inspired by Zhao Huo's roasted drumstick, she adapted the poem "Song of the Hero" by the poet Li Bai.

> Even in death, the hero's bones are fragrant, not ashamed to be the world's hero. Who can record your feats, the white-haired Tai Xuan Chicken.

After the Woyun Mountain incident, upon hearing the title of Drumstick Assassin, she composed half a poem.

> Killing all the evil people in the world, tasting all the delicious chicken on the ground.

Upon returning to Jinxiang Palace, Madam Wen was embarrassed by her favorite disciple and prepared a cane, waiting for Long Xiang to return to the palace to give her a beating and then find a private tutor to teach her to read from scratch.<br><br>
After leaving the Fengyu Mountain, resting at an inn, she woke up to find no drumsticks to compose with.

> Alas, no drumsticks at the morning market.

After the Western Martial Arts War, she refuted her lack of ink in her belly and could write her own lyrics, called "Longing for You, a Poem about Drumsticks," with an official [image](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=181922514361132&id=100076301525150&set=a.165167019370015).

> Marinated drumsticks. Roasted drumsticks, roasted to a light brown color are the most beautiful. The stomach growls like thunder.<br>
> Who are you. Who is he. Dismounting to smell the fragrance, all thoughts of returning home are forgotten. It's so delicious it brings tears to the eyes.

This poem was written by Xiong, not just this one. Currently, Long Xiang's series of poems can only be seen on limited routes.
