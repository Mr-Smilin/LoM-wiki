> "I want to worship not any other sect, only the Tang Clan! Willing to abide by the Tang Clan rules, accept punishment and repent in front of the ancestral hall, enter the poison sand tank, walk on the grassland, without any complaints."

A disciple of the Guangzhou Tang Clan, under the guidance of [[Tang Shouhong]]. Nicknamed "Little Whirlwind," he is known for his chivalrous deeds in the Guangzhou area and is a rising star. Since childhood, he has heard of the reputation of the [[Tang Clan]] and aspired to join, eager to learn from a master. When [[Tang Shouhong]] resided in Guangzhou, he went to worship him, unaware that he was not the true heir of the Tang Clan.
<br><br>
Later, he traveled to the [[Tang Clan|Shu Tang Clan]], climbed onto the roof to speak, attempting to persuade the Tang Clan disciples to let Tang Shouhong lead the clan. After failing and triggering a major battle, he faced [[Tang Moling]], realizing he was not a match for her and unwilling to harm her. He led her into the mountains to get lost, then returned to challenge [[Zhao Huo]]. After the defeat of the Guangzhou Tang Clan, he knelt at the main gate of the Tang Clan, begging for forgiveness.
<br><br>
If he pleads, he would be one of the only two disciples with a different surname, dedicating himself to the [[Tang Clan|Shu Tang Clan]] in the future.
<br><br>
If he leaves, he would kneel outside all night, harboring both respect and resentment towards the [[Tang Clan]], wiping away his tears as he descends the mountain, determined to make the Shu Tang Clan regret their decision one day.

## Notes

-   Joining is only available after v1.0.3200, before that, only the internal turmoil event was available.
-   ~~Roof Knight~~, loves shouting loudly on the roof.
-   If he joins and descends the mountain with [[Tang Buyi|Big Brother]], he will speak on behalf of the [[Tang Clan]] at the martial arts conference and reconcile with the [[Feishi Gang]].
-   Furthermore, if [[Tang Jiaojiao]] joins the Tang Clan, he will ~~not be able to shake her off due to her weak light skills~~ fall in love with her, asking [[Tang Sheng|Third Brother]] for marriage.
-   Never cooked a meal. [^1]
