<br><br>

A maidservant by [[Rui Xing]]'s side, who refers to Rui Xing as "princess." Lacks martial arts skills.
<br><br>
Originally the personal maid and close friend of [[Shangguan Ying]] during her youth, she was given to [[Rui Xing]] when the Shangguan Family encountered a difficult situation. As an adult, she still maintains a friendly relationship with Shangguan Ying, but harbors a competitive spirit towards [[Wei Ju]].
<br><br>
Of Tianzhu descent, she has a darker complexion and has suffered discrimination and bullying due to her foreign bloodline since childhood. Without the protection of Shangguan Ying and Rui Xing, she might not have survived to adulthood.
<br><br>
Originally surnamed Su, in order to help her cleanse her family background and marry into a good family in the future, she was bestowed the surname Shu by imperial decree, symbolizing that beauty is found within books. Influenced by this, she possesses excellent manners, knowledge, speech, and cultivation. Relying on Rui Xing's authority, even the powerful ministers of the court address her as "sister," and she has received many bribes, holding a higher position in the Rui Family than [[Rui Sheng]].
<br><br>
The book she holds is used for keeping grudges. Originally ordered by Rui Xing to keep records, Shu Rong later discovered the power that came with holding the book, leading to her understanding the joy that power brings.

-   Originally, it was written as "dance spoon age," but Niao Xiong accidentally spoiled it and changed it. Could Shu Rong's gender be...!?
-   Originally a romanceable character, but removed due to development pressure.
