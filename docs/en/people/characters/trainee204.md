Yan Jiang, known as "Mountain Fire," is the fire protector of the [[Kongtong Sect]].
<br><br>
His attacks are fierce like fire, once he unleashes his martial arts, it's like a forest fire that will not stop until everything is burned to ashes. If it weren't for him marrying a wife and taking on the role of fire protector, he would have been a strong contender for the sect leader position.
<br><br>
During Zhao Huo's time at the Kongtong Sect, Yan Jiang didn't treat him well, often mocking or intimidating him whenever they met.
<br><br>
He secretly admires [[Yu Xiaomei|Xiaomei]], but dares not covet the position of sect leader, so he settled down early to eliminate such thoughts.

## Notes

-   Served as the host during the Kongtong Sect's seasonal trials
-   If Golden Crow Monk is alive during the marriage proposal, he will kill Yan Jiang in a fit of anger after being defeated. If the true identity of Golden Crow is revealed, he will look at Zhao Huo differently and promise to help him gain favor with the Fire Dragon Immortal Lord.
-   In his eyes, Danxia Zi is the one qualified to contend for the sect leader position, not Golden Crow Monk.
