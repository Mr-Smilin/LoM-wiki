# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Meng Chen, also known as the "White Brow Tiger" of the Iron Fist Sect, was once grouped with Danxiazi from the Feitian Sect, Yanluosheng from the Xuangong Sect, and the Third Xiang from the Soul Snatching Sect, collectively known as the Four Outstanding Figures of the Kongtong Sect. He mastered the Iron Sand Palm technique and was poised to compete for a leading position among palm sect practitioners.

Unfortunately, he offended the Bone-Crushing Demon, resulting in all his palm bones being crushed. Even after being healed, he could never use martial arts again, and had to resort to selling buns in the morning market.
