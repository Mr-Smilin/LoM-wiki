Yue Ping, the top courtesan in Jiangling City, delicate and pitiful. She bonded with Nan Gong Shen over their shared love for music and he sympathized with her background, considering her a close friend. Shang Guan Ying, feeling jealous, said many derogatory things about her.
<br><br>
During the battle at Jiangling Chusheng Road, Yue Ping gave Nan Gong Shen a sachet she sewed overnight. In return, Shang Guan Ying offered him a Buddhist prayer bead from the temple, which he refused due to his family's strong Taoist beliefs.
<br><br>
After Nan Gong Heng's passing, Yue Ping became pregnant. Nan Gong Shen used Shang Guan Ying's abduction by Liu Ya as an excuse to break off the engagement and marry Yue Ping.
