## Biography

  <Tab title="Biography One">
	Tang Sheng is the third direct disciple of the head of the Tang Clan.<br>
	In his youth, full of passion, he studied diligently for over a decade,<br>
	vowing to achieve success and use his talents and knowledge to benefit the country.<br>
	However, due to offending the powerful, his dreams were shattered, leading to a life-threatening situation.<br><br>
	Fortunately, he had a fateful encounter with Tang Zhongling, who had not yet become the head of the clan, under a pavilion during a heavy rain.<br>
	In a moment of danger, he was saved by Tang Zhongling,<br>
	after experiencing a near-death situation, he abandoned his thoughts of serving the court and joined the Tang Clan.<br><br>
	His interests include storytelling and discussing martial world matters,<br>
	indifferent to life and death, he remains open-minded.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Two">
	In a rainy pavilion one year, he met Tang Zhongling and engaged in a carefree conversation about worldly matters.<br>
	One was a poor scholar, the other a wanderer of the martial world.<br>
	One focused on literature, the other on martial arts, although their paths differed,<br>
	they developed mutual respect.<br><br>
	Although he joined the Tang Clan to learn martial arts, their relationship resembled that of old friends, often enjoying tea and discussing life together.<br>
	Both the Eldest Senior Brother and the Second Senior Brother grew up under his watchful eye,<br>
	despite their seniority, he never acted superior.<br><br>
	Unfortunately, he started learning martial arts too late to compete with the heroes of the world,<br>
	yet he did not seek to be aggressive or ruthless,<br>
	as Sun Tzu said, the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy's strategy.<br>
	The true victor is one who avoids conflict.
  </Tab>

	"I have plans for national security, strategies for governance, health preservation methods, and enemy-defeating tactics, but only a wise ruler can implement them."<br>
	Despite his success in the imperial examination, when he dared to advise the Emperor, he offended the officials in power.<br>
	As a result, he was falsely accused, leading to the deaths of his elderly parents, wife, and hometown.<br><br>
	After weeping in prison for several days, as he was being escorted to the execution ground, he was rescued by Tang Zhongling and two young disciples.<br>
	"To all my fellow villagers, this man suffered imprisonment for the sake of the people's well-being,<br>
	he is the greatest hero in the world, remember this!"<br>
	Tang Zhongling's words left a deep impression, unforgettable to this day.

## Notes

-   He began his apprenticeship in his thirties, and according to the day he was found by [[Tang Weiyuan|Fourth Senior Brother]], the incident at the execution ground was about 18 years ago, hence the estimated age of 48.
-   His zodiac sign is Taurus in May.
-   Third Senior Brother is knowledgeable but conservative. He values etiquette and reads the classics.
-   He is usually busy in the scripture pavilion, to the point where he can't remember the last time he slept lying down, often falling asleep at his desk.
-   [[Zhao Huo]] joked that if he were kicked out of the mountain, he would start a new demonic sect called the Tang Sheng Sect.
-   Rumors in the martial world say that Third Senior Brother kidnaps elderly women over sixty, locks them up, and practices the evil martial arts inherited from the old demonic sect, causing harm.
-   The plot of the execution ground twenty years ago featured him with white hair, simply because there was no prepared artwork for a younger version.[^1]
-   Bird Bear mentioned that Third Senior Brother works harder than [[Xiang Wu Yi|Head Xiang]]. After all, the [[Emei Sect]] doesn't owe money, and its disciples don't cause trouble.~~Too hardworking~~[^2]
-   When [[Zhao Huo]] lost his ambition and left the mountain, Third Senior Brother gave him the money he had saved for years to use on his journey, claiming it was a gift from several senior brothers.
