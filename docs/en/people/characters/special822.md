# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Huyan Ju, the daughter of a former Kongtong sect leader, was assertive and aggressive due to her status. She bore a striking resemblance to Wei Ju, a distant relative, and was best friends with Xiahou Lan.
<br><br>
During Xiahou Lan and Tang Buyi's adventures in the jianghu, she exchanged vows with Di San Xiang. However, during a secret meeting with Di San Xiang, Xiahou Lan and Yan Luosheng stumbled upon them. In the ensuing chaos, she sacrificed herself to protect Xiahou Lan from Yan Luosheng's judgment pen, meeting a tragic end.
<br><br>
Despite Xiahou Lan's deep hatred, she still wished to be considered sisters with Huyan Ju before her death. Xiahou Lan continued to hold an umbrella in all weather, even if it meant deceiving herself, hoping to keep Huyan Ju's spirit alive.
