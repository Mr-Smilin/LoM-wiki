Tan Ba Dao, the hero of Kuizhou, is known for his famous weapon "Break Mountain Slash." He roams around Kuizhou, upholding justice, and drove the Salt Gang that used to control the Yangtze River out of his territory. His most famous battle was when he cleaved the entire person of Tuoba Bao, the leader of the Western Xia, in half.
<br><br>
In reality, he was the true culprit behind the grain robbery case in Jiangling Prefecture more than ten years ago. The "Break Mountain Slash" was a gift in return for selling official silver to Tuoba Bao, and he cleaved him to silence him. If Nangong Shouyan chooses the gift from his senior brother, there is a chance to capture him. After his defeat and tarnished reputation, he licked Nangong Yuan's shoes all over and begged Master Shi Ming to spare his life.
<br><br>
In order to restore his reputation, he will join the attack on the Tang Clan, whether it is wiping out a sect or the Western Wulin Line.

## Notes

-   ~~Also known as Wang Ba Dao~~
-   If he is not exposed at the banquet, due to his greed and lust, he once pretended to be crazy and insulted a virtuous woman while drunk, leading to a bounty placed on him by Song Bei and a tarnished reputation.
