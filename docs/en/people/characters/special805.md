> "Stairs are the most selfless accomplice for every pitiful person seeking revenge."

A senior crane practitioner who frequents the windows of the Feitian Gate of the Kongtong Sect, actually a spiritual crane that has been practicing on the mountain for a thousand years. After falling to his death, he reincarnated and resided in the right hand of [[Yu Xiaomei|Xiaomei]]. Enjoys introducing Xiaomei to new friends and showing people around the scenic spots of Kongtong Mountain.
<br><br>
After hearing the tragic story of [[Zhao Huo]], he suggested pushing his senior brother who loves to bully down the stairs. Stairs are just like weapons, there is no good or bad. It's the person standing at the top of the stairs who decides whether to do good or bad things.

## Notes

- The system specifically separates Crane Hand from [[Yu Xiaomei|Xiaomei]], so A He Xia is real! ~~Alas, this editor will pop out from time to time~~
- Communicates with [[Huo Shandian]] in crane hand form, and if Huo Shandian doesn't respond promptly or makes a "= =" expression, he will be slapped as a lesson.[^1]
