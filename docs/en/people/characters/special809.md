> "Those bastards from the martial arts alliance, must not have expected us to come from the town, town, town, town~ town ── damn it!"

A rising star in the Beggar Gang, clearly a beggar, yet named Fu Gui.

<br>

He is the orphan of the old-school elder [[Qian Jin Sou]] in the Beggar Gang, and also the stepson of the new-school leader and gang leader [[Wang Er Zhuang]].

<br>

He stutters when speaking, but is not actually foolish.

## Biography

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Biography One">
	Before his father joined the Beggar Gang, he had achieved fame and had only one son, Li Fu Gui, whom he doted on excessively. Li Fu Gui was unruly and mischievous, pulling up girls' skirts before he was even five years old.<br><br>
	Later, after Qian Jin Sou lost all his wealth and joined the Beggar Gang, Li Fu Gui remained arrogant and willful, relying on his father's reputation to act recklessly, until Wang Er Zhuang killed Qian Jin Sou, seized power, and took over the position of gang leader. With no one to support him, Li Fu Gui finally restrained himself, changed his name, and acknowledged Wang Er Zhuang as his father, intending to assassinate him.<br><br>
	Unbeknownst to him, Wang Er Zhuang saw through all his schemes, thinking that this child could endure hardships and grow stronger. However, Li Fu Gui couldn't control his impatience, and attempted to assassinate his father the same night, resulting in failure.<br><br>
	Punishment was necessary, but not through physical abuse or killing. Instead, he was forced to study, learn martial arts, and endure mental and physical torment.

## Notes

The information revealed in v3206 unpacking.

-   Originally named Ma Fu Gui, but due to suspected connection with [[Wang Er Zhuang]]'s original name, the surname was changed to Li.
-   Due to guilt over the destruction caused by the Beggar Gang and the Songshan Sect, he stayed in the outer fortress and assisted in repairs.
-   Worked various jobs to raise money for repairing the outer fortress. ~~Can a beggar who works and earns money still be called a beggar?~~
-   The foreman of the Feishi Gang said he was as strong as an ox, able to do the work of three people, which was very cost-effective.
-   Often encountered him asking for water when coming down the mountain. ~~Brother, do you have water?~~
-   Can cook some simple wild game dishes, as well as the specialty chicken passed down by [[Wang Er Zhuang|stepfather]].
-   Has complex feelings towards [[Wang Er Zhuang]], both admiring and idolizing his stepfather, while also seeking revenge for his father's murder.
-   Although [[Wang Er Zhuang|stepfather]] belongs to the new school, in reality, due to [[Qian Jin Sou|biological father]], he is part of the old school.
-   While [[Wang Er Zhuang|stepfather]] appeared to use him to stabilize the old-school elders, his true intention was for Li Fu Gui to eventually become the gang leader and mediate between the new and old schools, waiting for all the old-school elders to pass away before unifying the Beggar Gang.
-   The righteous act of avenging his family was the wish of [[Wang Er Zhuang|stepfather]]. Although he didn't want to do it, he had no choice but to carry it out.
-   With a favorability rating of ≧2★, he will offer advice to the Tang Sect and lead to the conclusion of the Western martial arts world.
-   The "Startling Snake Staff" in the final battle of the family extermination line is considered the strongest crowd control skill, making players itch with hatred.
-   Extremely afraid of [[Tang Zhong Ling|Old Demon Tang]], when they meet, not only does he stutter, but he also says things he shouldn't.
-   <MarkdownWrapper>||He couldn't lift his head in front of Wei Ju, because when his family was still prosperous, he and his friends went to a poetry meeting together and were amazed by this talented woman. He felt ashamed back then and now, as the leader of beggars, he is afraid of being recognized by her.||</MarkdownWrapper>
