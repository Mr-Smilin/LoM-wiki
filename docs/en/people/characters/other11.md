# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

A traitor of the Emei Sect, one of the Seven Immortals of the Jile Sect, known as the "Strange Ape in the Wind." He has a son named [[Yuan Wuxian]].
<br><br>
Based on the Emei's [[White Ape Reaching Arm Fist]], he created the seventy-two forms of the 'Great Sage Fist,' which are ever-changing. He excels in the use of the Ape King Staff, which is extremely agile. [[Tang Zhongling]] once commented on him: "Very difficult to defeat."
<br><br>
In his early years, he was a righteous knight-errant, but when the old demonic sect rose, he was defeated by the right-hand man of the Jile Sect. He knelt down and begged for mercy, swallowing the Heart-Stopping Pill to become a lackey of the Jile Sect. He later stole poison from the Tang Sect and poisoned his fellow Emei seniors, either killing them or crippling their martial arts skills. For this achievement, he was appointed as one of the Seven Immortals of the Jile Sect.
<br><br>
Tang Zhongling used the Flying Swallow Star Feather to cut off his weapon and fingers, and kicked him off the Emei Golden Peak. People thought he had already passed away, but he was alive and saved [[Nangong Qian]] to help him train his body. Nangong Qian, seeing him silent and dressed in ape skins, mistook him for a giant ape.
