## Biography

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Biography One">
	With poor eyesight, she often squints at people, giving off a fierce impression to everyone, but in reality, she is a kind-hearted girl.<br><br>
	As the direct female disciple of the Iron Fist Sect, she has the right to compete for the position of future sect leader's wife, but no one really respects her, and the sect seems to have given up on her, letting her reside in the large ironworks, far from a refined lady.<br><br>
	Her favorite iron hammer may be ordinary, but a pair of unremarkable gloves is a priceless treasure, woven from Tian Shan "Black Silkworm Silk," impervious to water and fire, and invulnerable to blades and spears.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Two">
	Sold to the Kongtong Sect due to her father's gambling addiction for five silver coins, her beauty and purity were the reasons for her price.<br>
	Initially thought to have a promising future, she stopped growing taller at some point, disappointing the Iron Fist Sect.<br><br>
	Yu Zhu herself has no expectations of becoming the sect leader's wife, but she cannot get used to the disdainful looks of others, feeling increasingly inferior and compelled to show strength.<br><br>
	She secretly envies ordinary young ladies who can attract sympathy with their delicate appearance.<br>
	Despite her petite and delicate appearance, she harbors immense strength and abnormal weight, lacking grace but possessing extraordinary power.<br><br>
	The only thing she can be grateful for is that the old sect leader who bought her as an apprentice left the large ironworks to her on his deathbed.<br>
	From then on, Yu Zhu handled the woodworking and ironworking in the mountains, sometimes forging farming tools, sometimes crafting weapons, and in her spare time, she delved into mechanical arts, consumed by inspiration, content even without becoming the sect leader's wife.<br><br>
	Her dream is to become a legendary craftsman like Luban and Ou Yezi.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Three">
	Her immense strength stems from being deceived by Xiao Mei in her childhood, leading her to ingest the "Iron-Scaled Black Python Blood." Subsequently, she suffered a high fever, weakened eyesight, and a change in physique, ceasing to grow taller but gaining increasing strength and weight even without martial arts training, potentially becoming incredibly powerful.<br>
	Although Yu Zhu claims not to care, she secretly holds a faint hope for the future sect leader, hoping he will be a good person, value her more than anyone else, and be exceptionally skilled in martial arts to make her appear more pitiful by comparison.<br><br>
	Indulging in unrealistic fantasies, this young girl in love spends her days honing her skills, hoping to contribute her modest efforts to her future husband.<br><br>
	Underneath her wardrobe lies a vibrant outfit she treasures, reluctant to wear even on special occasions, and she wears gloves to hide the calluses and scars on her hands.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Four">
	Her vague admiration gradually takes on a clear image, resembling you.<br>
	Even with poor eyesight, she would never mistake you for anyone else.<br>
	She remembers your features, your voice, your gait, the faint scent of medicine mixed with the smell of metal and gold on you.<br><br>
	In her eyes, you are different from anyone else, a rare kindred spirit, how fortunate? Her poor eyesight only allows her to see through the physical shell.<br>
	Yu Zhu doesn't delve into her feelings, just goes with the flow, you can see her true self, and she recognizes the real you.<br><br>
	Blushing to adorn herself for you, that vibrant green outfit, no one else but you can see it.<br>
	Aside from blacksmithing and sword forging, she actually prefers making toys, already a suitable bride, still fond of delicate dolls and puppets, afraid of damaging them, hence refrains from owning them.
