One of the most talked-about martial arts legends in the jianghu. Among his various legendary feats, the battle against the Supreme Leader of the Paradise Sect stands out the most. After the fall of the old Demon Sect and the disappearance of the strongest masters from both the righteous and evil paths, an era came to an end.
<br><br>
After the battle with the Paradise Sect, due to the betrayal of [[Wanyan Xun|King Yi]], he entrusted his daughter [[Long Xiang]] to [[Madam Wen]] and then severed his own arm, hiding his identity and lurking in the Beggar Sect's righteous division.

## Notes

-   Regularly visits the [[Jinxiang Palace]] with [[Wang Erzhuang]], just to catch a glimpse of [[Long Xiang]] from afar, which brings him great satisfaction.
-   Afraid of being recognized, he made little contribution to the Beggar Sect, only teaching a few moves to [[Fan Xiaotian]].
-   Few people know that Long Yuan is still alive. Apart from [[Wang Erzhuang]] and [[Madam Wen]], everyone else has passed away.
-   Officially part of the Da Zhi division, residing in the south. However, a year before the story begins, he came to Shu for the division leader to deliver a message, thinking that it didn't matter where a beggar stayed, so he never returned.
-   Although the Tang Sect and the righteous division are close, as [[Tang Zhongling|Tang Sect Leader]] is an old comrade, he always avoids meeting Tang Sect disciples.
