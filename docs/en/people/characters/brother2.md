[[Tang Clan]]'s Second Brother, reclusive by nature, spends most of his time researching in the alchemy room, making it difficult for others to approach him.

<br>

His mastery of poison techniques is extremely exquisite, and his actions are cautious, earning great respect and fear from his junior siblings.

<br>

However, only [[Tang Moling|Little Sister]] is not afraid of him and instead trusts Second Brother a lot.

## Notes

-   Introduction by Bird Bear FB: [Link](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=119387853792735&set=pcb.119387933792727)
-   His birthday is on 9/9, coinciding with the time when [[Hua Zhongxian|Hua Xian'er]] asked [[Zhao Huo]] to catch mountain chickens. [Source](https://banichi.lofter.com/post/1d0163b0_2bcc0e96e?incantation=rzkEdDEAUgU7)
-   Second Brother never jokes around, let alone talk about wanting to die. <BadendIcon :no="4">Life and Death Book No.4</BadendIcon>
-   He calls [[Zhao Huo]] useless and a foolish pig, never using their names.
-   He has a tough exterior but a kind heart. The higher the affinity, the harsher his words, yet the easier it is to increase affinity.
-   He participated in robbing a temple with [[Tang Zhongling]] and [[Tang Buyi|Senior Brother]] before the age of ten.
-   Assuming they were 7-9 years old during the temple robbery, and [[Tang Weiyuan]] was found the following year on a snowy day, his age can be estimated to be around 25-27.
-   Triple spy: "I was instructed by [[Jinxiang Palace]] to infiltrate the [[Tang Clan]]; instructed by [[Qiandeng Tower]] to infiltrate Jinxiang Palace; instructed by the Tang Clan to infiltrate Qiandeng Tower."
-   He will not cross-dress as a spy entering the [[Jinxiang Palace]]. ~~Tsk~~[^1]
-   He grew up with [[Tang Buyi|Senior Brother]] and has the longest relationship with him. He even lets Senior Brother copy his test papers. However, after Senior Brother became skilled and left to roam the world, he became stricter.
-   His zodiac sign is Virgo.
-   He has his own bed in the alchemy room for easy access to control the heat when brewing medicine.
-   The jade pendant once belonged to [[Tang Zhongling|Head]] and [[Tang Lu|Master]], the Head gave it to [[Tang Buyi|Senior Brother]], and the Master's is in Second Brother's possession, ~~a token of love perhaps~~. [Source](https://www.plurk.com/p/3g9a4xb0oh)
-   He loves pepper powder, and when the Tang Clan was small, no matter what dish [[Zhao Huo]] made, he would insist on adding more pepper. If others didn't eat it, he would be visibly unhappy until more people joined the clan.
-   When Second Brother is away, [[Zhao Huo]] sneaks in to use his pepper powder to make pepper cakes, adding a kick.
-   The main furnace in the alchemy room burns year-round, tending to the "Ten Thousand Longevity Corpse Heart Pill," a key to prolonging the Head's life. Do not add anything randomly! <BadendIcon :no="29">Life and Death Book No.29</BadendIcon>
-   He and [[Tang Buyi|Senior Brother]] once had a secret crush on a junior sister, who is [[Tang Fang]]'s sister. When Senior Brother and [[Zhao Huo]] talked about this, Second Brother's reaction was huge, suddenly erupting in anger and frightening [[Tang Moling|Little Sister]].
-   He holds a grudge against the [[Dian Cang Sect]], partly because he was injured by a Dian Cang sword in the past and also because they consider themselves upright gentlemen and look down on the Tang Clan's pharmaceutical studies.
