Di San Xiang of the Soul Stealing Sect, along with Feitian Sect's [[Danxia Zi]], Iron Fist Sect's "White Brow Tiger" [[Meng Xiong]], and Xuangong Sect's Danqing Luosha [[Yan Luo Sheng]], were collectively known as the Four Outstanding Youths of Kongtong, with the potential to compete for the leadership position.
<br><br>
Originally a disciple of the Snow Mountain Sect, Xiahou Lan looked down on him as an orphan and belittled him in every way. During the battle between Snow Mountain and Kongtong, he was knocked into the Snow Valley but miraculously survived. He later infiltrated Kongtong to rescue Xiahou Lan, and the two escaped together. They were discovered by Hu Yan Ju, who defeated them and Di San Xiang decided to stay, enduring hardships and learning skills to become a top disciple of the Soul Stealing Sect.
<br><br>
One day, Tang Buyi and two others invaded Kongtong, and Di San Xiang was surrounded and beaten, while Xiahou Lan was kidnapped and taken on an adventure. Later, during Xiahou Lan's travels, Di San Xiang exchanged marriage vows with Hu Yan Ju. When Xiahou Lan returned, suspecting her of having an affair with a fellow traveler, they got married to prove her innocence.
<br><br>
On another day, during a secret meeting between Di San Xiang and Hu Yan Ju, Xiahou Lan and Yan Luo Sheng stumbled upon them due to a scheme by Yu Xiaomei. In the ensuing chaos, Hu Yan Ju shielded Xiahou Lan from Yan Luo Sheng's judgment pen, sacrificing herself, and Di San Xiang killed Yan Luo Sheng.
<br><br>
This incident alarmed the sect leaders, who arrived with the Four Sect Masters, subdued Di San Xiang and Xiahou Lan, and imprisoned them in the Soul Stealing Peak, planning to execute them according to the mountain's laws. However, the sect leaders took responsibility for all the mistakes, admitting their wrongdoing, causing internal conflicts. They summoned distant relative Wei Ju to succeed his daughter as the leader of the Xuangong Sect, and later disbanded the Feitian Sect, dispersing the disciples.
<br><br>
After Xiahou Lan was released from prison, she immediately challenged Di San Xiang to a duel and was defeated. They agreed to meet again in seven years at the former site of Snow Mountain for a final battle.

## Notes

-   'Di San' is an extremely rare surname, originating from the Tian family during the Warring States period. When brought to Guanzhong by Emperor Gaozu of Han, they were renamed from the first to the eighth family based on arrival order. When the Liu family lost power, many reverted to the Tian surname or changed to the 'Wu' surname.
