## Biography

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Biography One">
	Wearing a red and white dress, resembling plum blossoms in the snow, exceptionally beautiful.<br><br>
	Though young, her status is high, more noble than the senior disciples of Feitian Gate, except for the four sect leaders, Xiaomei holds the most esteemed position.<br><br>
	Despite this, she does not have any airs, running around Kongtong Mountain daily, eager to help, lively and cheerful, loves to joke and laugh, skilled at making friends.<br><br>
	Keeps a celestial crane named Fire Lightning.<br><br>
	Among the contemporary Kongtong Four Beauties, she has the highest prestige, destined to marry a sect leader of Kongtong, becoming the first lady, as if it is already set in stone.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Two">
	Rumors say Xiaomei's birth mother was a demon woman from the Blissful Sect.<br><br>
	After her mother escaped the demon's clutches, she married and gave birth to a daughter, living a simple and happy life,<br>
	But good times didn't last, as Fire Dragon Immortal Lord, under the guise of eliminating evil, heartlessly tore apart the family, forcibly taking the orphaned Yu girl as a disciple, renaming her Xiaomei,<br>
	With the intention to cultivate her, aiming for the position of the first lady of the sect to solidify their power.<br><br>
	Thus, Xiaomei, seemingly innocent and cheerful, actually harbors hatred towards Kongtong Sect, always subtly manipulating situations towards negative outcomes as a form of revenge.<br><br>
	Even privately teaching her sect's secret skill "Crane Phantom Fist" to Fire Lightning, forcing the bird to learn martial arts, disregarding Fire Lightning's feelings, it's simply unreasonable.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Three">
	Even her pitiful background is a falsehood,<br>
	Just a fabricated and arranged false family to gain the trust of Kongtong Sect.<br><br>
	Her true identity is a cold-blooded assassin meticulously trained by the secretive organization "Qian Deng Tower," a new candidate for the Thousand-Faced Demon, adept at disguise, poison arts, deceit, rhetoric, and even capable of bewitching minds with enchantment techniques.<br>
	She secretly divides the Kongtong Four Gates, using seduction to kill numerous talented individuals of Kongtong, <br>
	Waiting for the right moment to overthrow the mighty Kongtong under her control, to gain recognition and inherit the name of the Thousand-Faced Demon.<br><br>
	All these are illusions, meant to deceive the observer Soul Hook Hermit, tricking him into revealing the antidote to the corpse heart poison.<br>
	Xiaomei's deep-seated hatred is directed towards only one person, the master of Qian Deng Tower, with no love in her heart, still breathing, wishing to kill that one person.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Four">
	Whenever you are nearby, Xiaomei's heart stirs with a conflicting mix of love and hate, <br>
	Wishing to stab you a few times, but ultimately unable to; finding you ugly, yet unable to let go.<br>
	At worst, you just have an unattractive appearance, unlike others with bland faces, indistinguishable from one another.<br><br>
	Though she hides it well, Xiaomei's obsession with you has become almost pathological.<br>
	If you are unfaithful and intend to have multiple wives, she would agree with a smile,<br>
	Then find an opportunity to push you down the stairs, leaving you half-dead,<br>
	Using enchantment to confine you, making you unable to go anywhere, relying on her for the rest of your life.<br>
	But if you are loyal and trustworthy, she would sacrifice her life for you, willingly.<br><br>
	The direction you gaze into is her future,<br>
	No matter how far, she will accompany you to the end, whether as life-and-death companions or partners.

## Notes

-   Moe
-   Claims that the soul of Ahe Xia resides in her right hand, believe it or not!
-   At the age of ten, she bought poison from [[Tang Weiyuan|Fourth Senior Brother]] in an attempt to poison [[Fire Dragon Immortal Lord]] and [[Golden Crow Monk]], but was tricked into taking a laxative, still holding a grudge against him to this day
-   Was once friends with [[Yu Zhu|Little Bamboo]], but due to the incident of tricking her into eating a spiritual medicine, [[Yu Zhu|Little Bamboo]] is still angry at her. She actually wants to reconcile with her, but fears implicating her in the Qian Deng Tower matter.
-   Extremely afraid of [[Xiahou Lan]], calling her Sister Lan, while the latter calls her Little Lunatic
-   Despite being instructed by Qian Deng Tower to kill many people, she actually didn't kill them, secretly sending them to a paradise
-   Excellent at cooking, can turn [[Zhao Huo]]'s failed dishes into delicacies, and her invented pastries are highly praised by the locals.
-   According to <EndIcon no="11">Ending 11</EndIcon>'s dialogue, if there is no bond, she will eventually become the master of Qian Deng Tower
-   <MarkdownWrapper>||In fact, the initial version had a very tragic ending, with six children with Golden Crow, but it was quickly revised after backlash.||</MarkdownWrapper>
