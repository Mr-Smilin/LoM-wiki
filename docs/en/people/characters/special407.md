The head of the Shang Guan family, with a daughter [[Shang Guan Ying]]. Calm and introverted, gradually withdrawing from the martial world, sealing the family heirloom "Golden Back Dragon King Blade," and not engaging in combat with anyone for nearly a decade.

<br>

He met [[Madame Wen|Su Ying Xiang]] when they were children. At that time, Shang Guan Zhun was unruly and often bullied her with his playmates, causing [[Madame Wen|Su Ying Xiang]] to be fearful. As they grew up, he saw [[Madame Wen|Su Ying Xiang]] becoming more beautiful and began to admire her, frequently pressuring people in the pleasure district to be with her. However, he was rescued by the young hero [[Nan Gong Yuan]], winning the heart of the woman he admired. Shang Guan Zhun then realized that he was thoroughly disliked.

<br>

He then transformed himself, restraining his arrogant temper, diligently practicing martial arts, reciting scriptures, and offering numerous rare treasures that even [[Nan Gong Yuan]] could not obtain, pretending to share the same ideals as [[Nan Gong Yuan]], all in the hope of changing the opinion of his beloved. Unfortunately, it was all a dream. From then on, he closed his heart to love, never marrying in his lifetime, even treating [[Shang Guan Ying]]'s mother as a mere plaything.

<br>

Under the order of the court, he secretly weakened the Tang Clan and instigated attacks on the Tang Clan in the martial world.

## Notes

-   ~~The collapsing domineering CEO character~~
-   His feelings towards [[Madame Wen|Su Ying Xiang]] are very complicated, involving possessiveness, recognition, admiration, and love-hate emotions. [^1]
-   He prefers fighting and killing over wealth and power, and if not for the Shang Guan family's single inheritance, he would have become a notorious criminal in the martial world.
-   After being baptized in despair by [[Tang Zhong Ling]], he reflected and restrained himself. He both fears and admires him, unable to admit it.
-   He is usually arrogant and has few close friends, with the former head of the Snow Mountain Sect being one of them. He regretted ignoring a plea for help from the Snow Mountain Sect.
-   His official position as the supervisor of the imperial shipyard seems to have been bought. He was promoted to imperial envoy during the Wind and Rain Mountain Conference, rising to the third rank, a fifth-rank official, appointed as an imperial envoy for pacification, with officials below the sixth rank in various counties serving as his assistants.
-   He was flattered by the Immortal Lord of the Fire Dragon, claiming he was the reincarnation of the Dragon King of the East Sea.
-   He looks down on women. During the battle at the Jin Xiang Palace when he was at a disadvantage, Zhao Huo made a famous remark:
    > ~~"Someone come quick! Lord Shang Guan was beaten by a woman! He's crying! How pitiful!"~~
-   After teaching Zhao Huo a lesson in the Western Martial Arts Competition, he was then killed in seconds by [[Tang Bu Yi|Senior Brother]].
    > "Everyone, take a look at who's lying on the ground? Stunned! It's the head of the Shang Guan family!"
