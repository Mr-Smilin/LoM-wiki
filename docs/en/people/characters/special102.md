<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Biography 1">
	Growing up in an environment of wealth and influence, he is clever and resourceful, adept at using family wealth and connections.

	Engaged to the daughter of Shang Guan, Shang Guan Ying, their encounters often lead to arguments or physical altercations.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography 2">
	Moved by the story of Chu's King Wu Jiang committing suicide at Wu River, he believes that relying solely on martial prowess is insufficient. He questions, which founding king in history relied solely on martial arts for success? Those who boast of their bravery often meet a premature end.<br><br>
	As a result, he dabbles in various pursuits without delving too deeply. While he is proficient in all four arts, he does not seek mastery.<br><br>
	His attitude towards learning both martial arts and literature is casual, often using his eloquence to navigate situations.<br><br>
	He believes that his true challenge lies in understanding and utilizing people, being able to command the strongest warriors and motivate the most knowledgeable scholars, truly becoming a superior individual.<br><br>
	Despite his talents, he cannot escape the typical behavior of a noble son, indulging in pleasures and socializing with a group known as the Four Gentlemen of Hua City, frequenting the lively streets and alleys.<br><br>
	If not for Shang Guan Ying's thin skin and strong fists, their engagement might have ended in chaos before the wedding.

## Notes

-   Treats people differently, despising the weak and showing a completely different attitude towards those with strength and skill
-   Manages eating and drinking~~, as well as indulging in vices~~
-   The author confirms his large chest, ~~truly a Deep V Hero~~
-   Extremely fearful of [[Tang Bu Yi]], has been beaten multiple times by masked individuals due to his philandering ways, and retaliated only to suffer more severe beatings
-   Friends with [[Wei Ju]] and [[Shang Guan Ying]] from the Geng Yang Study Hall
-   Engaged to [[Shang Guan Ying]], but broke off the engagement after impregnating [[Le Ping]] following the Battle of Jiang Ling
-   [[Wei Ju]] finds it difficult to compliment him, keeping a respectful distance. The original text reads:
    > "Associating with literati, yet boasting of martial arts heritage; having a deep but not profound understanding;<br>
    > 　Dabbling in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting without seeking mastery, pretending to be profound, but merely imitating elegance;<br>
    > 　Preferring ease over effort, admiring talented scholars, commanding laborers from a position of superiority, while looking down on farmers and merchants.<br>
    > 　His poems are vulgar and unpleasant, his calligraphy claims to have swordsmanship but is actually aggressive;<br>
    > 　Despite having a good fiancée like Shang Guan Lady, he still considers himself a romantic womanizer."
-   Legendary texts describe Nan Gong Shen in a particularly harsh manner, likely due to Wei Ju's influence
-   When fully on the defensive, he is impenetrable, even the [[Hua Zhong Xian]] would struggle to defeat him
-   In the Western Martial Arts line, there is a chance to encounter a super Nan Gong Shen wearing Phoenix Armor
-   Friends with Jing Jiang's Ninth County Little Alliance Leader [[Fang Zhen Tian]], Fire Flame Mountain's Chief Blacksmith [[Duan Chun Qing]], and the wielder of the Zhan Tian Black Wing Twin Swords [[Qi Ren]]
-   His mother is alive but no longer resides in the Nan Gong family, having returned to her maiden home many years ago with little contact with the [[Nan Gong Family]].[^1]
-   As a mediator in the martial arts world, he should not disclose confidential information, yet he revealed the identities of martial arts experts to the Tang Clan.
