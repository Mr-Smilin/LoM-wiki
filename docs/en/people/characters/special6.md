## Biography

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Biography One">
	He was once a character in stories, the chief of the Damo Hall in Songshan Temple, with the Dharma name Jue Kong, listed as one of the top ten martial artists in the martial arts world.<br><br>
	Monk Jue Kong is proficient in the seventh of the seventy-two martial arts, especially skilled in the external skill of Dragon Claw Hand.<br><br>
	His martial arts prowess is not inferior to the Abbot senior brother.<br><br>
	With high position and great virtue, he rarely roamed in the martial world. After reaching the age of destiny, he resigned from his position as the chief, traveled to the Six Paths Gorge in Xiangyang to challenge the Mud Sect Heavenly King, and then disappeared without a trace.<br><br>
	When he reappeared, he had already returned to secular life, calling himself Eagle Master.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Two">
	Seeking fame, he entered the world and roamed the martial world, but despite his active movements, the name of Eagle Master did not spread.<br><br>
	He continued to move between the borders of the Song and Jin dynasties, and there were rumors that he would assist in tyranny, winning sporadic battles and then lecturing the victorious Song soldiers, causing resentment.<br><br>
	Although old, he was quite bold, and although he did not associate with the heroes of the Central Plains, he was very popular among the people of both countries.<br><br>
	He loved wine, but his tolerance for alcohol was not great.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Three">
	Many years ago, someone sneaked a legendary novel "The Legend of the Bearded Guest" into the scripture pavilion.<br><br>
	Young monk Jue Kong happened to read it, was inspired by the heroic descriptions in the book, and became fascinated with martial arts.<br><br>
	Unfortunately, he had been a monk at Shaolin Temple since childhood, ignorant of worldly affairs, and influenced by the Buddhist teachings of abstaining from killing and avoiding greed, anger, and delusion. Although he longed to travel in the world, he found it difficult to overcome the obstacles he had set for himself. When he felt restless, he could only practice a few sets of martial arts to alleviate his troubles.<br><br>
	Although he was in seclusion, his heart was in the world. He endured several cycles of seasons, and even as the chief of the Damo Hall, he still felt empty.<br><br>
	Until the time when the old Demon Cult of the Blissful Sect was rampant, the young hero Long Yuan called on heroes, and Shaolin immediately responded. In that battle, he made a name for himself, astonishing everyone as the chief of the Damo Hall.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Four">
	After that battle, Mount Song suffered a great loss of vitality, and the Abbot's power dissipated, without attachment, but more devoutly devoted to Buddhism.<br><br>
	The remaining monks were inspired by him and returned to their original intentions, abandoning martial arts and other physical skills, and vigorously advancing in the study of Buddhist philosophy.<br><br>
	Only he remained, still restless after the aftermath of that battle.<br><br>
	Unable to break free from attachment, he resolutely resigned from the position of chief, traveled to the Mud Sect headquarters in the Six Paths Gorge, and debated and fought with the Heavenly King Xuan Yuan, but unexpectedly, despite his lifelong devotion to Buddhism, he could not persuade others, but was influenced by this mortal, realizing his deep-seated biases.<br><br>
	After sitting silently for several days, he finally decided to return to secular life, but unfortunately, when he wanted to grow his hair long, most of it had already fallen out.<br><br>
	He remembered the "The Legend of the Bearded Guest" he had read years ago, and wove the eagle feathers he had collected for many years into a cloak, embarking on a journey in the martial world as Wan Li Peng Cheng, completing his youth.
