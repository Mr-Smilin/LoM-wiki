Jiang Hang Lao, the head of the Jiangling Canal Transport Association, was introduced to Zhao Huo by Shangguan Ying before the Nangong Shou banquet.
<br><br>
The boat carrying rice, medicinal herbs, and dry goods ordered by the Zhong family in Anji Alley was detained due to a conflict with the Cang gang. Therefore, he shifted the blame to Zhao Huo, hoping to use the influence of the Tang Sect to downplay the situation.
