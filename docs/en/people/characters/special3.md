  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Biography Three">
	He harbors boiling hot blood in his heart, gripping his precious sword, rehearsing the moment of unsheathing it millions of times in his mind.<br><br>
	"Ye" is not actually his family name. In order to honor a promise that may never be fulfilled, their family gave up their original surname.<br><br>
	The name "Ye Yun" was chosen to commemorate an ancestor who served under Lord Yue Yun, even the Listening Cloud Sword means "obeying Yue Yun."<br><br>

	However, you seem to disappoint his expectations. You are not a saint, but your attachment to human emotions far exceeds the allure of treasure, leading him to believe that "righteousness" does exist in this world.
	He seems to understand his ancestor's selfish decision vaguely.<br><br>
	By saving the life of his only relative and saving his heart, you have transformed him from a vengeful being, unable to envision a future, into someone who is now truly living.

## Notes

-   ~~Chang Zhao's Sad Song~~
-   Introduction by Niao Xiong on Facebook: [Link](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=424312253455489&set=pb.100076301525150.-2207520000&type=3)
-   Original surname was "Hua."[^3]
-   If [[Ye Yun Shang]] dies, he will become the Dian Cang Sword Ghost, the Mad Swordsman Ye Yun Zhou.
-   Due to the fame of Breaking Cloud Pass, ~~his image in derivative works has also been affected~~
-   He did not feel guilty for owing [[Zhao Huo]] money and having a friend repay it for him, but he will silently repay the favor in other ways. [^1]
-   Continuing from above, he will repay debts, using various methods to do so. [^4]
-   While living in the outer fort, he served as a guard to pay rent. [^2]
-   Because his sister [[Ye Yun Shang]] is talkative, he once tried to study cooking to please her, but his achievements were mediocre. [^2]
-   Ye Yun Zhou's serious and cautious nature comes from his upbringing. However, children are naturally mischievous, enjoying playing hide-and-seek. It was only after the tragedy in the Ye family that he had to step up, acting as a father figure, and became serious from then on. [^5]
